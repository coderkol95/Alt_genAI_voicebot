Providing  universal  access  to quality  education  is the \\nkey to India’s continued  ascent,  and leadership  on the global  stage  in terms  of economic  growth,  \\nsocial  justice  and equality,  scientific  advancement,  national  integration,  and cultural  preservation.  \\nUniversal  high-quality  education  is the best way forward  for deve loping  and maximizing  our \\ncountry's  rich talents  and resources  for the good  of the individual,  the society,  the country,  and the \\nworld.  India  will have  the highest  population  of young  people  in the world  over the next decade,  and \\nour ability  to provide  high-quality  educational  opportunities  to them  will deter mine  the future  of our \\ncountry.   \\nThe global  education  development  agenda  reflected  in the Goal  4 (SDG4)  of the 2030  Agenda  for \\nSustainable  Development , adopted  by India  in 2015  - seeks  to “ensure  inclus ive and equitable  quality  \\neducation  and promote  lifelo ng learning  opportunities  for all” by 2030.  Such  a lofty  goal will require  \\nthe entire  education  system  to be reconfigured  to support  and foster  learning,  so that all of the critical  \\ntargets  and goals  (SDGs)  of the 2030  Agenda  for Sustainable  Development  can be achieved.   \\nThe world  is undergoing  rapid  changes  in the knowledge  landscape.  With  various  dramatic  scientific  \\nand technological  advances,  such as the rise of big data,  machine  learning,  and artific ial intelligence,  \\nmany  unskilled  jobs worldwide  may be taken  over by machines,  while  the need  for a skilled  \\nworkforce,  particularly  involving  mathematics,  computer  science,  and data science,  in conjunction  \\nwith multidisciplinary  abilities  across  the scienc es, social  sciences,  and humanities,  will be \\nincreasingly  in greater  demand.  With  climate  change,  increasing  pollution,  and depleting  natural  \\nresources,  there  will be a sizeable  shift in how we meet  the world ’s energy,  water,  food,  and \\nsanitation  needs,  again resulting  in the need  for new skille d labour,  particularly  in biology,  chemistry,  \\nphysics,  agriculture,  climate  science,  and social  science.  The growing  emergence  of epidemics  and \\npandemics  will also call for collaborative  research  in infectious  diseas e management  and \\ndevelopment  of vaccines  and the resultant  social  issues  heightens  the need  for multidisciplinary  \\nlearning.  There  will be a growing  demand  for humanities  and art, as India  moves  towards  becoming  a \\ndeveloped  country  as well as among  the three largest  economies  in the world.  \\nIndeed , with the quickly  changing  employment  landscape  and global  ecosystem,  it is becoming  \\nincreasingly  critical  that children  not only learn , but more  importantly  learn  how to learn.  Education  \\nthus, must  move  towards  less content,  and more  towards  learning  about how to think  critically  and \\nsolve  problems,  how to be creative  and multidisciplinary,  and how to innovate,  adapt,  and absorb  new \\nmaterial  in novel  and changing  fields.  Pedagogy  must  evolve  to make  education  more  experiential,  \\nholistic,  integrated,  inqui ry-driven,  discovery -oriented,  learner -centred,  discussion -based,  flexible,  \\nand, of course,  enjoyable.  The curriculum  must  include  basic  arts, crafts,  humanities,  games,  sports  \\nand fitness,  languages,  literature,  culture, and values,  in addition  to science  and mathematics,  to \\ndevelop  all aspects  and capabilities  of learne rs; and make  education  more  well-rounded,  useful,  and \\nfulfilling  to the learner.  Education  must  build  character,  enable  learners  to be ethical,  rational, \\ncompassionate,  and caring,  while  at the same  time prepare  them  for gainful,  fulfilling  employment.  \\nThe gap between  the current  state of learning  outcomes  and what  is required  must  be bridged  through  \\nundertaking  major  reforms  that bring  the highest  quality, equity,  and integrity  into the system, from  \\nearly  childhood  care and education  through  higher  education.  \\nThe aim must  be for India  to have  an education  system  by 2040  that is second  to none,  with equitable  \\naccess  to the highest -quality  education  for all learners  regardless  of social  or economic  background.   \\nThis National  Education  Policy  2020  is the first education  policy  of the 21st century  and aims  to \\naddress  the many  growing  developmental  imperatives  of our country . This Policy  proposes  the \\nrevisio n and revamping  of all aspects  of the education  structure,  including  its regulation  and \\ngovernance,  to create  a new system  that is aligned  with the aspirational  goals  of 21st century  \\neducation,  including  SDG4,  while  buildi ng upon India ’s traditions  and value systems.

       " Document(page_content=' \\n \\nNational  Education  Policy  2020  \\n4 \\n Education  Policy  lays particular  emphasis  on the development  of the creative  potential  of each \\nindividual.  It is based  on the principle  that education  must  develop  not only cognitive  capacities  - \\nboth the  ‘foundational  capacities   ’of literacy  and numeracy  and ‘higher -order’ cognitive  capacities , \\nsuch as critical  thinking  and problem  solving  – but also social,  ethical,  and emotional  capacities  and \\ndispositions .  \\nThe rich heritage  of ancient  and eternal  Indian  knowledge  and thought  has been a guiding  light for \\nthis Policy.  The pursuit  of knowledge  (Jnan ), wisdom  (Pragyaa ), and truth  (Satya) was always  \\nconsidered  in Indian  thought  and philosophy  as the highest  human  goal.  The aim of education  in \\nancient  India  was not just the acquisitio n of knowledge  as preparation  for life in this world,  or life \\nbeyond  schooling,  but for the complete  realization  and liberation  of the self. World -class  institutions  \\nof ancient  India  such as Takshashila,  Nalanda,Vikra mshila,  Vallabhi , set the highest  stand ards of \\nmultidisciplinary  teaching  and research  and hosted  scholars  and students  from  across  backgrounds  \\nand countries.  The Indian  education  system  produced  great  scholars  such as Charaka,  Susruta,  \\nAryabhata,  Varahami hira,  Bhaskaracharya,  Brahmagupta,  Chanakya,  Chakrapani  Datta,  Madhava,  \\nPanini,  Patanjali,  Nagarjuna,  Gautama,   Pingala,  Sankardev , Maitreyi,  Gargi  and Thiruvalluvar,  \\namong  numerous  others,  who made  seminal  contributions  to world  knowledge  in diverse  fields such \\nas mathematics,  astronomy,  meta llurgy,  medical  science  and surgery,  civil engineering , architecture,  \\nshipbuilding  and navigation,  yoga,  fine arts, chess,  and more.  Indian  culture  and philosophy  have  had \\na strong  influence  on the world.   These  rich legacies  to world  heritage  must  not only be nurtured  and \\npreserved  for posterity  but also researched,  enhanced,  and put to new uses through  our education  \\nsystem.   \\nThe teacher  must  be at the centre  of the fundamental  reforms  in the education  system. The new \\neducation  policy  must  help re-establis h teachers,  at all levels,  as the most  respected  and essential  \\nmembers  of our society,  because  they truly  shape  our next generation  of citizens.  It must  do \\neverything  to empower  teachers  and help them  to do their job as effectively  as possible.  The new \\neducation  policy  must  help recruit  the very best and brightest  to enter  the teaching  profession  at all \\nlevels,  by ensuring  livelihood,  respect,  dignity,  and autonomy,  while  also instilling  in the system  \\nbasic  methods  of quality  control  and accountability.  \\nThe new education  policy  must  provide  to all students,  irrespective  of their place  of residence,  a \\nquality  education  system,  with particular  focus  on historically  marginalized , disadvantaged,  and \\nunderrepresen ted groups.  Education  is a great  leveler  and is the best tool for achieving  economic  and \\nsocial  mobility,  inclusion,  and equality.  Initiatives  must  be in place  to ensure  that all students  from  \\nsuch groups,  despite  inherent  obstacles,  are provided  various  targeted  opportunities  to enter  and excel  \\nin the educational  system.  \\nThese  elements  must  be incorporated  taking  into account  the local  and global  needs  of the country,  \\nand with a respect  for and deference  to its rich diversity  and culture.  Instilling  knowle dge of India  and \\nits varied  social,  cultural,  and technological  needs,  its inimitable  artistic,  language,  and knowledge  \\ntraditions,  and its strong  ethics  in India ’s young  people  is considered  critical  for purposes  of national  \\npride,  self-confidence,  self-knowledge,  cooperation,  and integration . \\nPrevious  Policies  \\nThe implementation  of previous  policies  on education  has focused  largely  on issues  of access  and \\nequity.  The unfinished  agenda  of the National  Policy  on Education  1986,  modified  in 1992  (NPE  \\n1986/92),  is appropriately  dealt  with in this Policy.  A major development  since  the last Policy  of \\n1986/92  has been  the Right  of Children  to Free and Compulsory  Education  Act 2009  which  laid \\ndown  legal  underpinnings  for achieving  universal  elementary  education.  \\nPrinciples  of this Policy  \\nThe purpose  of the educat ion system  is to develop  good  human  beings  capable  of rational  thought  \\nand action,  possessing  compassion  and empathy,  courage  and resilience,  scientific  temper  and ', metadata={'source': '/Users/anupam/Documents/Debtanaya docs/National_Education_Policy_2020.pdf', 'page': 4}),\n",

       " Document(page_content=' \\n \\nNational  Education  Policy  2020  \\n7 \\n Currently,  children  in the age group  of 3-6 are not covered  in the 10+2  structure  as Class  1 begins  at \\nage 6. In the new 5+3+3+4  structure,  a strong  base of Early  Childhood  Care and Education  (ECCE)  \\nfrom  age 3 is also included,  which  is aimed  at promoting  better  overall  learning,  development,  and \\nwell-being.   \\n1. Early  Childhood  Care  and Education:  The Foundation  of Learning  \\n1.1. Over  85% of a child’s cumulative  brain  development  occurs  prior  to the age of 6, indicating  the \\ncritical  importance  of appropriate  care and stimulation  of the brain  in the early  years  in order  to \\nensure  healthy  brain  development  and growth.  Presently,  quality  ECCE  is not available  to crores  of \\nyoung  children,  particularly  children  from  socio-economically  disadvantaged  backgrounds.  Strong  \\ninvestment  in ECCE  has the potential  to give all young  children  such access,  enabling  them  to \\nparticipate  and flourish  in the educational  system  throughout  their lives.  Universal  provisioning  of \\nquality  early childhood  development,  care,  and education  must  thus be achieved  as soon  as possible,  \\nand no later than 2030,  to ensure  that all students  entering  Grade  1 are school  ready.  \\n1.2. ECCE  ideally  consists  of flexible,  multi -faceted,  multi -level,  play-based,  activity -based,  and \\ninquiry -based learning , comprising  of  alphabets,  languages,  numbers,  counting,  colours,  shapes,  \\nindoor  and outdoor  play,  puzzles  and logical  thinking,  problem -solving,  drawing,  painting  and other  \\nvisual  art, craft,  drama  and puppetry,  music  and movement.  It also includes  a focus  on developing  \\nsocial  capacities,  sensitivity,  good  behaviour,  courtesy,  ethics,  personal  and public  cleanliness,  \\nteamwork,  and cooperation.  The overall  aim of ECCE  will be to attain  optimal  outcomes  in the \\ndomai ns of: physical  and motor  devel opment,  cognitive  development,  socio -emotional -ethical  \\ndevelopment,  cultural/artistic  development,  and the development  of communication  and early  \\nlanguage,  literacy,  and numeracy.  \\n1.3. A National  Curricular  and Pedagogical  Framework  for Early  Childhood  Care and Education  \\n(NCPFE CCE) for children  up to the age of 8 will be developed  by NCERT  in two parts,  namely,  a \\nsub-framework  for 0-3 year-olds,  and a sub-framework  for 3-8 year-olds,  aligned  with the above  \\nguidelines,   the latest research  on ECCE,  and national  and international  best practices.  In particular,  \\nthe numerous  rich local  traditions  of India  developed  over millennia  in ECCE  involving  art, stories,  \\npoetry,  games,  songs,  and more,  will also be suitably  incorporated.  The framework  will serve  as a \\nguide  both for parents  and for early  childhood  care and education  institutions.  \\n1.4. The overarching  goal will be to ensure  universal  access  to high-quality  ECCE  across  the country  \\nin a phased  manner.  Special  attention  and priori ty will be given  to districts  and locations  that are \\nparticularly  socio -economically  disadvantaged.  ECCE  shall  be delivered  through  a significantly  \\nexpanded  and strengthened  system  of early -childhood  education  institutio ns consisting  of (a) stand -\\nalone  Anganwadis;  (b) Anganwadis  co-located  with primary  schools;  (c) pre-primary  \\nschools/sections  covering  at least age 5 to 6 years  co-located  with existing  primary  schools;  and (d) \\nstand -alone  pre-schools  - all of which  would  recruit  workers/teachers  specially  trained  in the \\ncurriculum  and pedagogy  of ECCE. \\n1.5. For universal  access  to ECCE , Anganwadi  Centres  will be strengthened  with high-quality  \\ninfrastructure,  play equipment,  and well-trained  Anganwadi  workers/teachers.  Ever y Anganwadi  will \\nhave  a well-ventila ted, well-designed,  child -friendly  and well-constructed  building  with an enriched  \\nlearning  environment.  Children  in Anganwadi  Centres  shall  take activity -filled  tours  - and meet  the \\nteachers  and students  of their local  primary  schools , in order  to make  the transition  from  Anganwadi  \\nCentres  to primary  schools  a smooth  one. Anganwadis  shall  be fully  integrated  into school  \\ncomplexes/clusters , and Anganwadi  children,  parents,  and teachers  will be invited  to attend  and \\npartici pate in school/school  complex  progra mmes  and vice versa.  \\n1.6. It is envisaged  that prior  to the age of 5 every  child  will move  to a “Preparatory  Class”  \\nor “Balavatika”  (that is, before  Class  1), which  has an ECCE -qualified  teacher.   The learning  \\nin the Preparatory  Class  shall  be based  primar ily on play-based  learning  with a focus  on \\ndeveloping  cognitive,  affective,  and psychomotor  abilities  and early  literacy  and numeracy.

To prepare  an initial  cadre  of high-quality  ECCE  teachers  in Anganwadis,  current  Anganwadi  \\nworkers/teachers  will be trained  through  a systematic  effort  in accordance  with the \\ncurricular/pedagogical  framework  developed  by NCERT.

These  programmes  may be run through  \\ndigital/distance  mode  using  DTH  channels  as well as smartphones,  allowing  teachers  to acquire  \\nECCE  qualifications  with minimal  disruption  to their current  work.  The ECCE  training of Anganwadi  \\nworkers/teachers  will be mentored  by the Cluster  Resource  Centres  of the School  Education  \\nDepartment  which  shall  hold at least one monthly  contact  class  for continuous  assessment.  In the \\nlonger  term,  State  Governments  shall  prepare  cadres  of professionally  qualified  educators  for early  \\nchildhood  care and education,  through  stage -specific  professional  training,  mentoring  mechanisms,  \\nand career  mapping.  Necessary  facilities  will also be created  for the initial  professional  preparation  of \\nthese educators  and their Continuous  Professional  Development  (CPD).  \\n1.8. ECCE  will also be introduced  in Ashramshalas  in tribal -dominated  areas  and in all formats  of \\nalternative  schooling  in a phased  manner.  The process  for integration  and implementation  of ECCE  \\nin Ashramshalas  and alternative  schooling  will be similar  to that detailed  above.  \\n1.9. The responsibility  for ECCE curriculum  and pedagogy  will lie with MHRD  to ensure  its \\ncontinuity  from  pre-primary  school  through  primary  school,  and to ensure  due attention  to the \\nfoundational  aspects  of education.  The planning  and implementation  of early  childhood  care and \\neducation  curriculum  will be carried  out jointly  by the Ministries  of HRD,  Women  and Child  \\nDevelopment  (WCD),  Health  and Family  Welfare  (HFW),  and Tribal  Affairs.  A special  joint task \\nforce  will be constituted  for continuous  guidance  of the smooth  integration  of early  childhood  care \\nand education  into school  education .  \\n2. Foundational  Literacy  and Numeracy:  An Urgent  & Necessary  Prerequisite  to Learning  \\n2.1. The ability  to read and write,  and perform  basic  operations  with numbers,  is a necessary  \\nfoundation  and an indispensable  prerequisite  for all future  schooling  and lifelong  learning.  However,  \\nvarious  governmental,  as well as non-governmental  surveys,  indicate  that we are currently  in a \\nlearning  crisis:  a large  proportion  of students  currently  in elementary  school  - estimated  to be over 5 \\ncrore  in number  - have  not attained  foundational  literacy  and numeracy,  i.e., the ability  to read and \\ncomprehend  basic  text and the ability  to carry  out basic  addition  and subtraction  with Indian  \\nnumerals.   \\n2.2. Attaining  foundational  literacy  and numeracy  for all children  will thus become  an urgent  \\nnational  mission,  with immediate  measures  to be taken  on many  fronts  and with clear  goals  that \\nwill be attained  in the short  term (including  that every  student  will attain  foundational  literacy  \\nand nume racy by Grade  3). The highest  priority  of the education  system  will be to achieve  \\nuniversal  foundational  literacy  and numeracy  in primary  school  by 2025. The rest of this Policy  \\nwill become  relevant  for our students  only if this most basic  learning  require ment  (i.e., reading,  \\nwriting,  and arithmetic  at the foundational  level)  is first achieved.  To this end, a National  \\nMission  on Foundational  Literacy  and Numeracy  will be set up by the Ministry  of Human  \\nResource  Development  (MHRD ) on priority.  Accordingly,  all State/UT  governments  will \\nimmediately  prepare  an implementation  plan for attaining  universal  foundational  literacy  and \\nnumeracy  in all primary  schools,  identifying  stage -wise targets  and goals  to be achieved  by 2025, and \\nclosel y tracking  and monitoring  progress  of the same.  \\n2.3. First,  teacher  vacancies  will be filled  at the earliest , in a time-bound  manner  - especially  in \\ndisadvantaged  areas  and areas  with large  pupil -to-teacher  ratios  or high rates  of illiteracy .

A \\npupil -teacher  ratio (PTR)  of under  30:1 will be ensured  at the level  of each school;  areas  having  large  \\nnumbers  of socio -economically  disadvantaged  students  will aim for a PTR of under  25:1.  Teachers  \\nwill be trained,  encouraged,  and supported  - with continuous  professional  development   - to impart  \\nfoundational  literacy  and numeracy.   \\n2.4. On the curricular  side, there  will be  an increased  focus  on foundational  literacy  and numeracy  - \\nand generally,  on reading,  writing,  speaking,  counting,  arithmetic,  and mathematical  thinking  - \\nthroughout  the preparatory  and middle  school  curriculum,  with a robust  system  of continuous  \\nformative/adaptive  assessment  to track  and thereby  individualize  and ensure  each student's  learning.  \\nSpecific  hours  daily  - and regular  events  over the year-on activities  involving  these  subjects  will be \\ndedicated  to encourage  and enthuse  students . Teacher  education  and the early  grade  curriculum  will \\nbe redesigned  to have  a renewed  emphasis  on foundational  literacy  and numeracy.  \\n2.5. Currently , with the lack of universal  access  to ECCE,  a large  proportion  of children  already  fall \\nbehind  within  the first few weeks  of Grade  1. Thus,  to  ensure  that all students  are school  ready, an \\ninterim  3-month  play-based  ‘school  preparation  module’   for all Grade  1 students,  consisting  of \\nactivities  and workbooks  around  the learning  of alphabets,  sounds,  words,  colours,  shapes,  and \\nnumbers,  and involving  collaborations  with peers  and parent s, will be developed  by NCERT  and \\nSCERTs.  \\n2.6. A national  repository  of high-quality  resources  on foundational  literacy  and numeracy  will be \\nmade  available  on the Digital  Infrastructure  for Knowledge  Sharing  (DIKSHA).  Technological  \\ninterventions  to serve  as aids to teachers  and to help bridge  any language  barriers  that may exist \\nbetween  teachers  and students,  will be piloted  and implemented  \\n2.7. Due to the scale  of the current  learning  crisis,  all viable  methods  will be explored  to support  \\nteachers  in the mission  of attaining  universal  foundational  literacy  and numeracy.  Studies  around  the \\nworld  show  one-on-one peer tutoring  to be extremely  effect ive for learning  not just for the learner,  \\nbut also for the tutor.  Thus,  peer tutoring  can be taken  up as a volun tary and joyful  activity  for fellow  \\nstudents  under  the supervision  of trained  teachers  and by taking  due care of safety  aspects.  \\nAdditionally,  it will also be made  far easier  for trained  volunteers  - from  both the local  community  \\nand beyond  - to participat e in this large -scale  mission.   Every  literate  member  of the community  \\ncould  commit  to teaching  one student/person  how to read,  it would  change  the country ’s landscape  \\nvery quickly . States  may consider  establishing  innovative  models  to foster  such peer-tutoring  and \\nvolunteer  activities,  as well as launch  other  programmes  to support  learners , in this nationwide  \\nmission  to promote  foundational  literacy and numeracy.  \\n2.8. Enjoyable  and inspirational  books  for students  at all levels  will be developed,  including  through  \\nhigh-quality  translation  (technology  assisted  as needed)  in all local  and Indian  languages,  and will be \\nmade  available  extensively  in both school  and local  public  libraries.  Public  and school  libraries  will \\nbe significantly  expanded  to build  a culture of reading  across  the country.  Digital  libraries  will also \\nbe established.  School  libraries  will be set up - particularly  in villages  - to serve  the community  \\nduring  non-school  hours,  and book  clubs  may meet  in public/school  libraries  to further  facilitate and \\npromote  widespread  reading.  A National  Book  Promotion  Policy  will be formulated , and extensive  \\ninitiatives  will be undertaken  to ensure the availability,  accessibility,  quality,  and readership  of books  \\nacross  geographies,  languages,  levels,  and genres.   \\n2.9. Children  are unable  to learn  optimally  when  they are undernourished  or unwell.  Hence,  the \\nnutrition  and health  (including  mental  health)  of children  will be addressed,  through  healthy  meals  \\nand the introduction  of well-trained  social  workers,  counsellors,  and community  involvement  into the \\nschooling  system . Furthermore,  research  shows  that the morning  hours  after a nutritious  breakfa st can \\nbe particularly  productive  for the study  of cognitively  more  demanding  subjects  and hence    these  \\nhours  may be leveraged  by providing  a simple  but energizing  breakfast  in addition  to midday  meals.  \\nIn locations  where  hot meals  are not possible,  a simple but nutritious  meal,  e.g., groundnuts /chana  \\nmixed  with jaggery  and/or  local  fruits  may be provided.

Curtailing  Dropout  Rates  and Ensuring  Universal  Access  to Education  at All Levels  \\n3.1. One of the primary  goals  of the schooling  system  must  be to ensure  that children  are enrolled  in \\nand are attending  school.  Through  initiatives  such as the Sarva  Shiksha  Abhiyan  (now  the Samagra  \\nShiksha ) and the Right  to Education  Act, India  has made  remarkable  strides  in recent years  in \\nattaining  near-universal  enrolment  in elementary  education.  However,  the data for later grades  \\nindicates  some  serious  issues  in retaining  children  in the schooling  system . The GER  for Grades  6-8 \\nwas 90.9%,  while  for Grades  9-10 and 11-12 it was only 79.3%  and 56.5%,  respectively  - indicating  \\nthat a significant  proportion  of enrolled  students  drop out after Grade  5 and especially  after Grade  8. \\nAs per the 75th round  househo ld survey  by NSSO  in 2017 -18, the number  of out of school  children  in \\nthe age group  of 6 to 17 years  is 3.22 crore.  It will be a top priority  to bring  these  children  back  into \\nthe educational  fold as early  as possible,  and to prevent  further  students  from  dropping  out, with a \\ngoal to achieve  100%  Gross  Enrolment  Ratio  in presch ool to secondary  level  by 2030 . A concerted  \\nnational  effort  will be made  to ensure  universal  access  and afford  opportunity  to all children  of the \\ncountry  to obtain  quality  holistic  education–including  vocational  education  - from  pre-school  to \\nGrade  12.  \\n3.2. There  are two overall  initiatives  that will be undertaken  to bring  children  who have  dropped  out \\nback  to school  and to prevent  further  children  from  dropping  out. The first is to provide  effective  and \\nsufficient  infrastructure  so that all students  have access  to safe and engaging  school  education  at all \\nlevels  from  pre-primary  school  to Grade  12. Besides  providing  regular  trained  teachers  at each stage,  \\nspecial  care shall  be taken  to ensure  that no school  remains  deficient  on infrastructure  support.  The \\ncredibility  of Government  schools  shall  be re-established  and this will be attained  by upgrading  and \\nenlarging  the schools  that already  exist,  building  additional  quality  schools  in areas where  they do not \\nexist,  and providing  safe and practical  conveyance s and/or  hostels,  especially  for the girl children,  so \\nthat all children  have  the opportunity  to attend  a quality  school  and learn  at the appropriate  level.  \\nAlternative  and innovative  education  centres  will be put in place  in cooperation  with civil society  to \\nensure  that children  of migrant  labourers,  and other  children  who are dropping  out of school  due to \\nvarious  circumstances  are brought  back  into mainstream  education.   \\n3.3. The second is to achieve  universal  participation  in school  by carefully  tracking  students,  as well \\nas their learning  levels,  in order  to ensure  that they (a) are enrolled  in and attending  school,  and (b) \\nhave  suitable  opportunities  to catch  up and re-enter  school  in case they have fallen  behind  or dropped  \\nout. For providing  equitable  and quality  education  from  the Foundational  Stage  through  Grade  12 to \\nall children  up to the age of 18, suitable  facilitating  systems  shall  be put in place.  Counsellors  or well-\\ntraine d social  workers  connected  to schools/school  complexes  and teachers  will continuously  work  \\nwith students  and their parents  and will travel  through  and engage  with communities  to ensure  that all \\nschool -age children  are attending  and learning  in school.  Trained  and qualified  social  workers  from  \\ncivil society  organizations/departm ents of Social  Justice  and Empowerment  and government  \\nfunctionaries  dealing  with empowerment  of Persons  with Disabilities  at the State  and district  level,  \\ncould  be connected  to schools,  through  various  innovative  mechanisms  adopted  by State/UT  \\nGovernments,  to help in carrying  out this important  work.  \\n3.4. Once  infrastructure  and participa tion are in place,  ensuring  quality  will be the key in retention  of \\nstudents,  so that they (particularly , girls and students  from  other  socio -economically  disadvantaged  \\ngroups) do not lose interest  in attending  school.  This will require  a system  of incenti ves for deploying  \\nteachers  with knowledge  of the local  language  to areas  with high dropout  rates,  as well as \\noverhauling  the curriculum  to make  it more  engaging  and useful.  \\n3.5. To facilitate  learning  for all students,  with special  emphasis  on Socio-Economically  \\nDisadvantaged  Groups  (SEDGs),  the scope  of school  education  will be broadened  to facilitate  \\nmultiple  pathways  to learning  involving  both formal  and non-formal  educat ion modes.

       " Document(page_content=' \\n \\nNational  Education  Policy  2020  \\n11 \\n and State  Open  Schools  will be expanded  and strengthened  for meeting  the learning  needs  of young  \\npeople  in India  who are not able to attend  a physical  school.  NIOS  and State  Open  Schools  will offer  \\nthe following  programmes  in addition  to the present  progra mme s: A, B and C levels  that are \\nequivalent  to Grades  3, 5, and 8 of the formal  school  system;  secondary  education  programme s that \\nare equival ent to Grades  10 and 12; vocational  education  courses/ programme s; and adult  literacy  and \\nlife-enrichment  programme s. States  will be encouraged  to develop  these  offerings  in regional  \\nlanguages  by establishing  new/ strengthening  existing  State  Institutes  of Open Schooling  (SIOS).  \\n3.6. To make  it easier  for both governments  as well as non-governmental  philanthropic  organi zations  \\nto build  schools,  to encourage  local  variations  on account  of culture,  geography,  and demographics,  \\nand to allow  alternative  models  of education,  the requirements  for schools  will be made  less \\nrestrictive.  The focus  will be to have less emphasis  on input  and greater  emphasis  on output  potential  \\nconcerning  desired  learning  outcomes.  Regulations  on inputs  will be limited  to certain  areas  as \\nenumerated  in Chapter  8. Other  models  for schools  will also be piloted,  such as public -philanthropic  \\npartnership s. \\n3.7. Efforts  will be made  to involve  community  and alumni  in volunteer  efforts  for enhancing  \\nlearning  by providing  at schools : one-on-one tutoring;  the teaching  of literacy  and holding  of extra -\\nhelp sessions;  teaching  support  and guidance  for educators;  career  guidance  and mentoring  to \\nstudents;  etc. In this regard,  the support  of active  and healthy  senior  citizens , school  alumni  and \\nlocal  community  members  will be suitably  garnered.  Databases  of literate  volunteers,  retired  \\nscientists /government/semi  government  employees,  alumni,  and educators  will be created  for this \\npurpose.  \\n4. Curriculum  and Pedagogy  in Schools:  Learning  Should  be Holistic , Integrated,  \\nEnjoyable,  and Engaging  \\nRestructuring  school  curriculum  and pedagogy  in a new 5+3+3+4  design  \\n4.1. The curricular  and pedagogical  structure  of school  education  will be reconfigured  to make  it \\nresponsive  and relevant  to the developmental  needs  and interests  of learners  at different  stages  of \\ntheir development,  corresponding  to the age ranges of 3-8, 8-11, 11-14, and 14-18 years,  respectively.  \\nThe curricular  and pedagogical  structure  and the curricular  framework  for school  education  will \\ntherefor e be guided  by a 5+3+3+4  design,  consisting  of the Foundational  Stage  (in two parts,  that is, \\n3 years  of Anganwadi/pre -school  + 2 years  in primary  school  in Grades  1-2; both together  covering  \\nages 3-8), Preparatory  Stage  (Grades  3-5, covering  ages 8-11), Middle  Stage  (Grades  6-8, covering  \\nages 11-14), and Secondary  Stage  (Grades  9-12 in two phases,  i.e., 9 and 10 in the first  and 11 and \\n12 in the second , covering  ages 14-18). \\n4.2. The Foundational  Stage  will consist  of five years  of flexible,  multilevel,  play/activity -based  \\nlearning  and the curriculum  and pedagogy  of ECCE as mentioned  in para 1.2. The Preparatory  Stage  \\nwill comprise  three  years  of education  building  on the play,  discovery,  and activity -based  \\npedagogical  and curricular  style  of the Foundatio nal Stage,  and will also begin  to incorporate  some  \\nlight text books  as well as aspects  of more formal  but interactive  classroom  learning,  in order  to lay a \\nsolid  groundwork  across  subjects,  including  reading,  writing,  speaking,  physical  education,  art, \\nlanguages,  science,  and mathematics.  The Middle  Stage  will comprise  three  years  of education , \\nbuilding  on the pedagogical  and curricular  style  of the Preparatory  Stage,  but with  the introduction  \\nof subject  teachers  for learning  and discussion  of the more  abstract concepts  in each subject  that \\nstudents  will be ready  for at this stage  across  the scien ces, mathematics,  arts, social  sciences,  and \\nhumanities.  Experiential  learning  within  each subject,  and explorations  of relations  among  different  \\nsubjects,  will be encouraged  and emphasi zed despite  the introduction  of more  speciali zed subjects  \\nand subject  teachers.  The Secondary  Stage  will comprise  of four years  of multidisciplinary  study,  \\nbuilding  on the subject -oriented  pedagogical  and curricular  style  of the Middl e Stage,  but with greater  \\ndepth,  greater  critical  thinking,  greater  attention  to life aspira tions,  and greater  flexibility  and student  \\nchoice  of subjects.

The above -described  stages  are purely  curricular  and pedagogical,  designed  to optimize  learning  \\nfor students  based on the cognitive  development  of children;  they will inform  the development  of \\nNational  and State  curricula  and teaching -learning  strategies  at each stage,  but parallel  changes  to \\nphysical  infrastructure  will not be required . \\nHolistic  development  of learners  \\n4.4. The key overall  thrust  of curriculum  and pedagogy  reform  across  all stages  will be to move  the \\neducation  system  towards  real understanding  and towards  learning  how to learn  - and away  from  the \\nculture  of rote learning  as is largely  present  today . The aim of education  will not only be cognitive  \\ndevelopment,  but also building  character  and creating  holistic  and well-rounded  individuals  equipped  \\nwith the key 21st century  skills.  Ultimately,  knowledge  is a deep -seated  treas ure and education  helps  \\nin its manifestation  as the perfection  which  is already  within  an individual.  All aspects  of curriculum  \\nand pedagogy  will be reoriented  and revamped  to attain  these  critical  goals.  Specific  sets of skills  and \\nvalues  across  domains  will be identified  for integ ration  and incorporation  at each stage  of learning,  \\nfrom  pre-school  to higher  education.  Curriculum  frameworks  and transaction  mechanisms  will be \\ndeveloped  for ensuring  that these skills  and values  are imbib ed through  engaging  processes  of \\nteaching  and learning.  NCERT  will identify  these  required  skill sets and include  mechanisms  for their \\ntransaction  in the National  Curriculum  Framework  for early  childhood  and school  education.   \\nReduce  curriculum  content  to enhance  essential  learning  and critical  thinking  \\n4.5. Curriculum  content  will be reduced  in each subject  to its core essentials,  to make  space  for \\ncritical  thinking  and more  holistic,  inquiry -based,  discovery -based,  discussion -based,  and analysis -\\nbased  learning.  The mandated  content  will focus  on key concepts,  ideas,  applications,  and problem -\\nsolving.  Teaching  and learning  will be conducted  in a more  interactive  manner;  questions  will be \\nencouraged,  and classroom  sessions  will regularly  contain  more  fun, creative,  collaborative,  and \\nexploratory  activities  for students  for deeper  and more  experiential  learning.  \\nExperiential  learning  \\n4.6. In all stages,  experiential  learning  will be adopted,  including  hands -on learning,  arts-integr ated \\nand sports -integrated  education,  story -telling -based  pedagogy,  among  others, as standard  pedagogy  \\nwithin  each subject,  and with explorations  of relations  among  different  subjects.  To close  the gap in \\nachievement  of learning  outcomes,  classroom  transac tions  will shift,  towards  competency -based  \\nlearning  and education.  The assessm ent tools  (including  assessment  “as”, “of”, and “for” learning)  \\nwill also be aligned  with the learning  outcomes,  capabilities,  and dispositions  as specified  for each \\nsubject  of a given  class.   \\n4.7. Art-integration  is a cross -curricular  pedagogical  approach  that utilizes various  aspects  and forms  \\nof art and culture  as the basis  for learning  of concepts  across  subjects.  As a part of the thrust  on \\nexperiential  learning,  art-integrated  education  will be embedded  in classroom  transactions  not only \\nfor creating  joyful  classrooms,  but also for imbibing  the Indian  ethos  through  integration  of Indian  art \\nand culture  in the teaching  and learning  process  at every  level.  This art-integrated  approach  will \\nstrengthen  the linkages  between  education  and culture.  \\n4.8. Sports -integration  is another  cross -curricular  pedagogical  approach  that utilizes physical  \\nactivities  including  indigenous  sports , in pedagogical  practices  to help in developing  skills  such as \\ncollaboration,  self-initiative,  self-direction,  self-discipline,  team work,  responsibility,  citizenship,  etc. \\nSports -integrated  learning  will be undertaken  in classroom  transactions  to help students  adopt  fitness  \\nas a lifelong  attitude  and to achieve  the related  life skills  along  with the levels  of fitness  as envisaged  \\nin the Fit India  Movement.

However,  at times  in multi -lingual  families,  \\nthere  can be a home  language  spoken  by other  family  members  which  may sometimes  be different  \\nfrom  mother  tongue  or local language.  Wherever  possible,  the medium  of instruction  until at least \\nGrade  5, but preferably  till Grade  8 and beyond,  will be the home  language/mother  tongue/local  \\nlanguage/regional  language.  Thereafter,  the home/local  language  shall  continue  to be taught  as a \\nlanguage  wherever  possible.  This will be followed  by both public  and private  schools.  High -quality  \\ntextbooks,  including  in science,  will be made  available  in home  languages /mother  tongue.  All efforts  \\nwill be made  early  on to ensure  that any gaps that exist between  the language  spoken  by the child  and \\nthe medium  of teaching  are bridged.  In cases  where  home  language /mother  tongue  textbook  material  \\nis not available,  the language  of transaction  between  teachers  and students  will still remain  the home \\nlanguage /mother  tongue  wherever  possible.  Teachers  will be encouraged  to use a bilingual  approach,  \\nincluding  bilingual  teaching -learning  materia ls, with those  students  whose  home  language  may be \\ndifferent  from  the medium  of instruction.  All languages  will be taught  with high quality  to all \\nstudents;  a language  does not need  to be the medium  of instruction  for it to be taught  and learned  \\nwell.  \\n4.12. As research  clearly  shows  that children  pick up languages  extremely  quickly  between  the ages \\nof 2 and 8 and that multilingualism  has great  cognitive  benefits  to young  students,  children  will be \\nexposed  to different  languages  early  on (but with a particul ar emphasis  on the mother  tongue),  \\nstarting  from  the Foundational  Stage  onwards.  All languages  will be taught  in an enjoyable  and \\ninteractive  style,  with plenty  of interactive  conversation,  and with early  reading  and   subsequently  \\nwriting  in the mother  tongue  in the early  years,  and with skills  developed  for reading  and writing  in \\nother  languages  in Grade  3 and beyond.  There  will be a major  effort  from  both the Central  and State  \\ngovernments  to invest  in large  numbers  of language  teachers  in all regional  languages  around  the \\ncountry,  and, in particular , for all languages  mentioned  in the Eighth  Schedule  of the Constitution  of \\nIndia.  States,  especially  States  from  different  regions  of India,  may enter  into bilateral  agreements  to \\nhire teachers  in large  number s from  each other,  to satisfy  the three -language  formula  in their \\nrespective  States,  and also to encourage  the study  of Indian  languages  across  the country.

The three -language  formula  will continue  to be implemented  while keeping  in mind  the \\nConstitutional  provisions,  aspirations  of the people,  regions,  and the Union,  and the need  to promote  \\nmultilingualism  as well as promote  national  unity.  However,  there  will be a greater  flexibility  in the \\nthree -language  formula,  and no language  will be imposed  on any State.  The three  languages  learned  \\nby children  will be the choices  of States,  regions,  and of course  the students  themselves , so long as at \\nleast two of the three  languages  are native  to India.  In particular,  students  who wish  to change  one or \\nmore  of the three  languages  they are studying  may do so in Grade  6 or 7, as long as they are able to \\ndemonstrate  basic  proficiency  in three languages  (including  one language  of India  at the literature  \\nlevel)  by the end of secondary  school.  \\n4.14.  All efforts  will be made  in preparing  high-quality  bilingual  textbooks  and teaching -learning  \\nmaterials  for science  and mathematics,  so that studen ts are enabled  to think  and speak  about  the two \\nsubjects  both in their home  language /mother  tongue  and in English.   \\n4.15.  As so many  developed  countries  around  the world  have  amply  demonstrated,  being  well \\neducated  in one’s language,  culture,  and tradition s is not a detriment  but indeed  a huge  benefit  to \\neducational,  social,  and technological  advancement.  India ’s languages  are among  the richest,  most  \\nscientific,  most  beautiful,  and most  expressive  in the world,  with a huge  body  of ancient  as well as \\nmodern  literature  (both  prose  and poetry),  film,  and music  written  in these  langua ges that help form  \\nIndia ’s national  identity  and wealth.  For purposes  of cultural  enrichment  as well as national  \\nintegration,  all young  Indians  should  be aware  of the rich and vast array  of languages  of their country,  \\nand the treasures  that they and their literatures  contain.  \\n4.16. Thus,  every  student  in the country  will participate  in a fun project/activity  on ‘The Languages  \\nof India ’, sometime  in Grades  6-8, such as, under  the ‘Ek Bharat  Shrestha  Bharat’ initiative . In this \\nproject/activity,  students  will learn  about  the remarkable  unity  of most  of the major  Indian  languages,  \\nstarting  with their common  phonetic  and scientifically -arranged  alphabets  and scripts,  their common  \\ngrammati cal structures,  their origins  and sources  of vocabularies  from  Sanskrit  and other  classical  \\nlanguages,  as well as their rich inter-influences  and differences.  They  will also learn  what  \\ngeographical  areas  speak  which  languages,  get a sense  of the nature  and structure  of tribal  languages,  \\nand learn  to say commonly  spoken  phrases  and sentences  in every  major  language  of India  and also \\nlearn  a bit about  the rich and uplifting  literature  of each (through  suitable  translations  as necessary).  \\nSuch  an activity  woul d give them  both a sense  of the unity  and the beautiful  cultural  heritage  and \\ndiversity  of India  and would  be a wonderful  icebreaker  their whole  lives  as they meet  people  from  \\nother  parts  of India.  This project/activity  would  be a joyful  activity  and would  not involve  any form  \\nof assessment.  \\n4.17. The importance,  relevance,  and beauty  of the classical  languages  and literature  of India  also \\ncannot  be overlooked.  Sanskrit,  while  also an important  modern  language  mentioned  in the Eighth  \\nSchedule  of the Constit ution  of India , possesses  a classical  literature  that is greater  in volume  than \\nthat of Latin  and Greek  put together,  containing  vast treasures  of mathematics,  philosophy,  grammar,  \\nmusic,  politics,  medicine,  architecture,  metallurgy,  drama,  poetry,  storyte lling,  and more  (known  as \\n‘Sanskrit  Knowledge  Systems ’),  written  by people  of various  religions  as well as non-religious  \\npeople,  and by people  from  all walks  of life and a wide  range  of socio -economic  backgrounds  over \\nthousands  of years.  Sanskrit  will thus be offered  at all levels  of school  and higher  education  as an \\nimportant,  enriching  option  for students,  including  as an option  in the three -language  formula.  It will \\nbe taught  in ways  that are interesting  and experiential  as well as contemporarily  releva nt, including  \\nthrough  the use of Sanskrit  Knowledge  Syste ms, and in particular  through  phonetics  and \\npronunciation.  Sanskrit  textbooks  at the foundational  and middle  school  level  may be written  in \\nSimple  Standard  Sanskrit  (SSS)  to teach  Sanskrit  through  Sanskrit  (STS)  and make  its study  truly \\nenjoyable.  \\n4.18. India also has an extremely  rich literature  in other  classical  languages,  including  classical  \\nTamil,  Telugu,  Kannada,  Malayalam,  Odia.  In addition  to these  classical  languages  Pali, Persian,  and \\nPrakri t; and their works  of literature  too must  be preserved  for their richness  and for the pleasure  and \\nenrichment  of posterity.

In addition  to \\nproficiency  in languages,  these  skills  include:  scientific  temper  and evidence -based  thinking;  \\ncreativity  and innovativeness;  sense  of aestheti cs and art; oral and written  communication;  health  and \\nnutrition;  physical  education,  fitness,  wellness,  and sports;  collaboration  and teamwork;  problem  \\nsolving  and logical  reasoning;  vocational  exposure  and skills;  digital  literacy,  coding,  and \\ncomputatio nal thinking;  ethical  and moral  reasoning ; knowledge  and practice  of human  and \\nConstitutional  values;  gender  sensitivity;  Fundamental  Duties;  citizenship  skills  and values;  \\nknowledge  of India;  environmental  awareness  includi ng water  and resource  conservati on,  sanitation  \\nand hygiene;  and current  affairs  and knowledge  of critical  issues  facing  local  communities,  States,  the \\ncountry,  and the world.   \\n4.24.

The \\nNCFSE  document  shall  henceforth  be revisited  and updated  once  every  5-10 years , taking  into \\naccount  frontline  curriculum . \\nNational  Textbooks  with  Local  Content  and Flavour  \\n4.31. The reduction  in content  and increased  flexibility  of school  curriculum  - and the renewed  \\nemphasis  on constructive  rather  than rote learning  - must  be accompanied  by parallel  changes  in \\nschoo l textbooks.  All textbooks  shall  aim to contain  the essential  core material  (together  with \\ndiscussion,  analysis,  examples,  and applications)  deemed  important  on a national  level,  but at the \\nsame  time contain  any desired  nuances  and supplementary  material  as per local  contexts  and needs.  \\nWhere  possible,  schools  and teachers  will also have choices  in the textbooks  they employ  - from  \\namong  a set of textbooks  that contain  the requisite  national  and local  material  - so that they may teach  \\nin a manner  that is best suited  to their own pedagogical  styles  as well as to their students  and \\ncommunities ’ needs . \\n4.32. The aim will be to provide  such quality  textbooks  at the lowest  possible  cost -namely,  at the \\ncost of production/printing  - in order  to mitigate  the burden  of textbook  prices  on the students  and on \\nthe educational  system.  This may be accomplished  by using  high-quality  textbook  materials  \\ndeveloped  by NCERT  in conjunction  with the SCERTs;  additional  textbook  materials  could  be \\nfunded  by public -philanthropic  partnerships  and crowd  sourcing  that incentivize  experts to write  such \\nhigh-quality  textbooks  at cost price.  States  will prepare  their own curricula  (which  may be based  on \\nthe NCFSE  prepared  by NCERT  to the extent  possible)  and prepare  textbooks  (which  may be based  \\non the NCERT  textbook  materials  to the extent possible),  incorporating  State  flavour  and material  as \\nneeded.  While  doing  so, it must  be borne  in mind  that NCERT  curriculum  would  be taken as the \\nnationally  acceptable  criterion . The availability  of such textbooks  in all regional  languages  will be a \\ntop priority  so that all students  have  access  to high-quality  learning.  All efforts  will be made  to ensure  \\ntimely  availability  of textbooks  in schools.  Access  to downloadable  and printable  versions  of all \\ntextbooks  will be provided  by all States/UTs  and NCERT  to help conserve  the environment  and \\nreduce  the logistical  burden.  \\n4.33. Concerted  efforts,  through  suitable  changes  in curriculum  and pedagogy,  will be made  by \\nNCERT,  SCERTs,  schools,  and educators  to significantly  reduce  the weight  of school  bags and \\ntextbooks.   \\nTransforming  Assessment  for Student  Development  \\n4.34.

The primary  purpose  of assessment  \\nwill indeed  be for learning ; it will help the teacher  and student,  and the entire  schooling  system,  \\ncontinuously  revise  teaching -learning  processes  to optimize  learning  and development  for all \\nstudents.  This will be the underlying  principle  for assessment  at all levels  of education.  \\n4.35.

The holistic  progress  card will form  an \\nimportant  link between  home  and school  and will be accompanied  by parent -teacher  meeting s in \\norder to actively  involve  parents  in their children’s  holistic  education  and development . The progress  \\ncard would  also provide  teachers  and parents  with valuable  information  on how to support  each \\nstudent  in and out of the classroom.

The current  nature  of secondary  school  exams,  including  Board  exams  and entrance  exams  - \\nand the resulting  coaching  culture  of today  - are doing  much  harm, especially  at the secondary  school  \\nlevel,  replacing  valuable  time for true learning  with excessive  exam  coaching  and preparation.  These  \\nexams  also force  students  to learn  a very narrow  band  of material  in a single  stream,  rather  than \\nallowing  the flexibility  and choice  that will be so important  in the education  system  of the future.   \\n4.37. While  the Board  exams  for Grades  10 and 12 will be continued,  the existing  system  of Board  \\nand entrance  examinations  shall  be reformed  to eliminate  the need  for under taking  coaching  classes.  \\nTo reverse  these  harmful  effects  of the current  assessment  system,  Board  exams  will be redesigned  to \\nencourage  holistic  development;  students  will be able to choose  many  of the subjects  in which  they \\ntake Board  exams,  depending  on their individualized  interests.  Board  exams  will also be made  \\n‘easier ’, in the sense  that they will test primarily  core capacities /competencies  rather  than months  of \\ncoaching  and memorization ; any student  who has been going  to and making  a basic  effort  in a school  \\nclass  will be able to pass and do well in the corresponding  subject  Board  Exam  without  much  \\nadditional  effort.  To further  eliminate  the ‘high stakes’  aspect  of Board  Exams,  all stude nts will be \\nallowed  to take Board  Exams  on up to two occasions  during any given  school  year,  one main  \\nexamination  and one for improvement , if desired.   \\n4.38. In addition  to introducing  greater  flexibility,  student  choice,  and best-of-two attempts , \\nassessme nts that primarily  test core capacities  must  be the immediate  key reforms  to all Board  exams . \\nBoards  may over time also develop  further  viable  models  of Board  Exams  that reduce  pressure  and \\nthe coaching  culture.  Some  possibilities  include:  a system  of annu al/semester/modular  Board  Exams  \\ncould  be developed  - that each test far less material,   and are taken  immediately  after the \\ncorresponding  course  is taken  in school  - so that the pressure  from  exams  is better  distributed,  less \\nintense,  and less high-stakes  across  the Secondary  Stage ; all subjects  and corresponding  assess ments,  \\nbeginning  with mathematics,  could  be offered  at two levels,  with students  doing  some  of their \\nsubjects  at the standard  level  and some  at a higher  level;  and Board  exams  in certain  subjects could  be \\nredesigned  to have  two parts  – one part of an objec tive type with multiple -choice  questions  and the \\nother  of a descriptive  type.  \\n4.39. With  regard  to all of the above,  guidelines  will be prepared  by NCERT,  in consultation  with \\nmajor  stakehold ers, such as SCERTs,  Boards  of Assessment  (BoAs),  the proposed  new National  \\nAssessment  Centre  etc., and teachers  prepared,  for a transformation  in the assessment  system  by the \\n2022 -23 academic  session,  to align  with the NCFSE  2020 -21.  \\n4.40.

This Centre  will also advise  school  boards  regarding  new assessment  \\npatterns  and latest  researches,  promote  collaborations  between  school  boards . It will also become  an \\ninstrument  for the sharing  of best practices  among  school  boards,  and for ensuring  equivalence  of \\nacademic  standards  among  learners  across  all school boards.  \\n4.42. The principles  for university  entrance  exams  will be similar . The National  Testing  Agency  \\n(NTA)  will work  to offer  a high-quality  common  aptitude  test, as well as specialized  common  subject  \\nexams  in the sciences,  humanities,  languages,  arts, and vocational  subjects,  at least twice  every  year.  \\nThese  exams  shall  test conceptual  understanding  and the ability  to apply  knowledge  and shall  aim to \\neliminate  the need  for taking  coaching  for these  exams.  Students  will be able to choose  the subjects    \\nfor taking  the test, and each university  will be able to see each student ’s individual  subject  portfolio  \\nand admit  students  into their programmes  based  on individual  interests  and talents.  The NTA  will \\nserve  as a premier,  expert,  autonomous  testing  organ ization  to conduct  entrance  examinations  for \\nundergraduate  and graduate  admissions  and fellowships  in higher  education  institutions.  The high \\nquality,  range,  and flexibility  of the NTA  testing  services  will enable  most  universities  to use these  \\ncommon  entrance exams  - rather  than having  hundreds  of universities  each devising their own \\nentrance  exams  - thereby  drastically  reducing  the burden  on students,  universities  and colleges,  and \\nthe entire  education  system.  It will be left up to individual  universities  and colleges  to use NTA  \\nassessments  for their admissions.  \\nSupport  for Gifted  Students/Students  with  Special  Talents  \\n4.43. There  are innate  talents  in every student,  which  must  be discovered,  nurtured,  fostered,  and \\ndeveloped.  These  talents  may express  themselves  in the form  of varying  interests,  dispositions,  and \\ncapaci ties. Those  students  that show  particularly  strong  interests  and capacities  in a given  realm  must  \\nbe encouraged  to pursue  that realm  beyond  the general  school  curriculum.  Teacher  education  will \\ninclude  methods  for the recognition  and fostering  of such student talents  and interests.  The NCERT  \\nand NCTE  will develop  guidelines  for the education  of gifted  children.  B.Ed.  programmes  may also \\nallow  a specialization  in the education  of gifted  children.   \\n4.44. Teachers  will aim to encourage  students  with singular  interests  and/or  talents  in the classroom  \\nby giving  them  supplementary  enrichment  material  and guidance  and encouragement.  Topic -centered \\nand Project-based  Clubs  and Circles  will be encouraged  and supported  at the levels  of schools,  school  \\ncomplexes,  distri cts, and beyond.  Examples  include  Science  Circles,  Math  Circles,  Music  & Dance  \\nPerformance  Circles,  Chess  Circles,  Poetry  Circles,  Language  Circl es, Drama  Circles,  Debate  \\nCircles,  Sports  Circles,  Eco-Clubs , Health  & Well -being  Clubs/  Yoga  Clubs  and so on. Along  these  \\nlines,  high-quality  national  residential  summer  programmes  for secondary  school  students  in various  \\nsubjects  will also be encouraged , with a rigorous  merit -based  but equitable  admission  process  to \\nattract  the very best students  and teachers  from across  the country  including  from  socio -economically  \\ndisadvantaged  groups.  \\n4.45. Olympiads  and competitions  in various  subjects  will be conduct ed across  the country,  with clear  \\ncoordination  and progression  from  school  to local  to state to national  levels , to ensure  that all students  \\nmay participate  at all levels  for which  they qualify.  Efforts  will be made  to make  these  available  in \\nrural  areas  and in regional  languages  to ensure  widespread  participation.  Public  and private  \\nuniversities,  including  premier  institutions  like the IITs and NITs,  would  be encouraged  to use merit -', metadata={'source': '/Users/anupam/Documents/Debtanaya docs/National_Education_Policy_2020.pdf', 'page': 19}),\n",

Once  internet -connected  smart  phones  or tablets  are available  in all homes  and/or  schools,  \\nonline  apps with quizzes,  competitions,  assess ments,  enrichment  materials,  and online  communities  \\nfor shared  interests  will be developed,  and will work  to enhance  all the aforementioned  initiatives,  as \\ngroup  activities  for students  with appropriate  supervision  of parents  and teachers.  Schools  will   \\ndevelop  smart  classrooms , in a phased  manner,  for using  digital  pedagogy  and thereby  enriching  the \\nteaching -learning process  with online  resources  and collaborations.   \\n5. Teachers  \\n5.1. Teachers  truly  shape  the future  of our children  - and, therefore,  the future of our nation.  It is \\nbecause  of this noblest  role that the teacher  in India  was the most  respected  member  of society.  Only  \\nthe very best and most  learned  became  teachers.  Society  gave  teachers,  or gurus,  what  they needed  to \\npass on their knowledge,  skills, and ethics  optimally  to students.  The quality  of teacher  education,  \\nrecruitment,  deployment,  service  cond itions,  and empowerment  of teachers  is not where  it should  be, \\nand consequently  the quality  and motivation  of teachers  does not reach  the desired  standards . The \\nhigh respect  for teachers  and the high status  of the teaching  profession  must  be restored  so as to \\ninspire  the best to enter  the teaching  profession . The motivation  and empowerment  of teachers  is \\nrequired  to ensure  the best possible  future  for our children  and our nation.  \\nRecruitment  and Deployment  \\n5.2. To ensure  that outstanding  students  enter  the teaching  profession  - especially  from  rural  areas  - a \\nlarge  number  of merit -based  scholarships  shall  be instituted  across  the country  for studying  quality  4-\\nyear integrated  B.Ed.  programme s. In rural  areas,  special  merit -based  scholarships  will be establis hed \\nthat also include  preferential  employment  in their local  areas  upon  successful  completion  of their \\nB.Ed.  programme s. Such  scholarships  will provide  local  job opportunities  to local  students , especially  \\nfemale  students,  so that these  students  serve  as local-area role models  and as highly  qualified  teachers  \\nwho speak  the local  language.  Incentives  will be provided  for teachers  to take up teaching  jobs in \\nrural  areas,  especially  in areas  that are currently  facing  acute  shortage  of quality  teachers.  A key \\nincentive  for teaching  in rural  schools  will be the provision  of local  housing  near or on the school  \\npremises  or increased  housing  allowances.  \\n5.3. The harmful  practice  of excessive  teacher  transfers  will be halted,  so that students  have \\ncontinuity  in their role models  and educational  environments.  Transfers  will occur  in very special  \\ncircumstances,  as suitably  laid down  in a structured  manner  by State/UT  governments.  Furthermore , \\ntransfers  will be conducted  through  an online  computeri zed system  that ensures  transparency.  \\n5.4. Teacher  Eligibility  Tests  (TETs)  will be strengthened  to inculcate  better  test material,  both in \\nterms  of content  and peda gogy.  The TETs  will also be extended  to cover  teachers  across  all stages  \\n(Foundational,  Preparatory,  Middle  and Secondary)  of school  education.  For subject  teachers,  \\nsuitable  TET or NTA  test scores  in the corresponding  subjects  will also be taken  into account for \\nrecruitment.  To gauge  passion  and motivation  for teaching,  a classroom  demonstration  or interview  \\nwill become an integral  part of teacher  hiring  at schools  and school  complexes.  These  interviews  \\nwould  also be used to assess  comfort  and proficiency  in teaching  in the local  language,  so that every  \\nschool/school  complex  has at least some  teachers  who can converse  with students  in the local  \\nlanguage  and other  prevalent  home  languages  of students.  Teachers  in private  schools  also must  have \\nqualified  similarly through  TET,  a demonstration/interview,  and knowledge  of local  language(s).  \\n5.5. To ensure  an adequate  numbe r of teachers  across  subjects  - particularly  in subjects  such as art, \\nphysical  education,  vocational  education,  and languages  - teachers  could  be recruited  to a school  or \\nschool  complex  and the sharing  of teachers  across  schools  could  be considered  in accordance  with the \\ngrouping -of-schools  adopted  by State/UT  governments.

       " Document(page_content=' \\n \\nNational  Education  Policy  2020  \\n21 \\n 5.6. Schools /school  complexes  will be encouraged  to hire local  eminent  persons  or experts  as  ‘master  \\ninstructors ’  in various  subjects,  such as in traditional  local  arts, vocational  crafts , entrepreneurship,  \\nagriculture,  or any other  subject  where  local  expertise  exists , to benefit  students  and help preserve  \\nand promote  local  knowledge  and professions.  \\n5.7. A technology -based  comprehensive  teacher -requirement  planning  forecasting  exercise  will be \\nconducted  by each State  to assess  expected  subject -wise teacher  vacancies  over the next two decades.  \\nThe above  described  initiatives  in recruitment  and deployment  will be scaled  as needed  over time,  to \\nfill all vacancies  with qualified  teachers,  including  local  teachers,  with suitable  incentives  for career  \\nmanagement  and progression  as described  below.  Teacher  education  programme s and offerings  will \\nalso align  with the vacancies  thus projected.  \\nService  Environment  and Culture  \\n5.8. The primary  goal of overhauling  the service   environment  and culture  of schools  will be to \\nmaximi ze the ability  of teachers  to do their jobs effectively,  and to ensure  that they are part of \\nvibrant,  caring,  and inclusive  communities  of teachers,  students,  parents,  principals , and other  support  \\nstaff,  all of whom  share  a common  goal:  to ensure  that our children  are learning.  \\n5.9. The first requirement  in this direction  will be to ensure  decent  and pleasant  service  conditions  at \\nschools.  Adequate  and safe infrastructure,  includ ing working  toilets,  clean  drinking  water,  clean  and \\nattractive  spaces,  electricity,  computi ng devices,  internet,  libraries,  and sports  and recreational  \\nresources  will be provided  to all schools  to ensure  that teachers  and students , including  children  of all \\ngenders  and children  with disabilities,  receive  a safe, inclusive,  and effective  learning  environment  \\nand are comfortable  and inspired  to teach  and learn  in their schools.  In-service  training  will have  \\ninputs  on safety,  health  and environment  at workpla ce in schools  to ensure  that all teachers  are \\nsensitized  to these  requirements.  \\n5.10.  State/UT  Governments  may adopt  innovative  formats,  such as school  complex,  rationali zation  \\nof schools , without  in any way reducing  accessibility , for effective  school  governance,  resource  \\nsharing,  and community  building.  The creation  of school  comple xes could  go a long way towards  \\nbuilding  vibrant  teacher  communities.  The hiring  of teachers  to school  complexes  could  \\nautomatically  create  relationships  among  schools  across  the school  complex;  it would  also help \\nensure  excellent  subject -wise distribution  of teachers,  creating  a more  vibrant  teacher  knowledge  \\nbase.  Teachers  at very small  schools  will not remain  isolated  any longer  and may become  part of and \\nwork  with larger  school complex  communities,  sharing  best practices  with each other  and working  \\ncollaboratively  to ensure  that all children  are learning.  School  complexes  could  also share  \\ncounsellors,  trained  social  workers,  technical  and maintenance  staff,  etc. to further  support  teachers  \\nand help create  an effective  learning  environment.  \\n5.11.  In colla boration  with parents  and other  key local  stakeholders,  teachers  will also be more  \\ninvolved  in the governance  of schools/school  complexes,  including  as members  of the School  \\nManagement  Committees/School  Complex  Management  Committees.  \\n5.12.  To prevent  the large amounts  of time spent  currently  by teachers  on non-teaching  activities , \\nteachers  will not be engaged  any longer  in work  that is not directly  related  to teaching;  in partic ular, \\nteachers  will not be involved  in strenuous  administrative  tasks  and more  than a rationali zed minimum  \\ntime for mid-day meal  related  work , so that they may fully  concentrate  on their teaching -learning  \\nduties.  \\n5.13.  To help ensure  that schools  have  positive learning  environments,  the role expectations  of \\nprincipals  and teachers  will explicitly  include  developing  a caring  and inclusive  culture  at their \\nschools,  for effective  learning  and the benefit  of all stakeholders . \\n5.14.  Teachers  will be given  more  autonomy  in choosing  aspects  of pedagogy,  so that they may teach  \\nin the manner  they find most  effective  for the students  in their classrooms .

Teachers  will be \\nrecognized  for novel  approaches  to teaching  that improve  learning  outcomes  in their classrooms.  \\nContinuous  Professional  Development  (CPD)  \\n5.15.  Teachers  will be given  continuous  opportunities  for self-improvement  and to learn  the latest  \\ninnov ations  and advances  in their professions . These  will be offered  in multiple  modes,  including  in \\nthe form  of local,  regional,  state, national,  and international  workshops  as well as online  teacher  \\ndevelopment  modules.  Platforms  (especially  online  platforms)  will be developed  so that teachers  may \\nshare  ideas and best practices.  Each  teacher  will be expected  to participate  in at least 50 hours  of CPD  \\nopportunities  every  year for their own professional  development,  driven  by their own interests . CPD  \\nopportuniti es will, in particular,  systematically  cover  the latest  pedagogies  regarding  foundational  \\nliteracy  and numeracy,  formative  and adaptive  assessment  of learning  outcomes,  competency -based  \\nlearning,  and related  pedagogies,  such as experiential  learning,  arts-integrated,  sports -integrated,  and \\nstorytelling -based  approaches,  etc. \\n5.16.  School  Principals  and school  complex  leaders  will have similar  modular  \\nleadership/management  workshops  and online  development  opportunities  and platforms  to \\ncontinuously  improve  their own leadership  and management  skills,  and so that they too may share  \\nbest practices  with each other.  Such  leaders  will also be expected  to participate  in 50 hours  or more  of \\nCPD  modules  per year,  covering  leadership  and management,  as well as content  and pedagogy  with a \\nfocus  on preparing  and implementing  pedagogical  plans  based  on competency -based  education.  \\nCareer  Management  and Progression  (CMP)  \\n5.17.  Teachers  doing  outstanding  work  must  be recognized  and promoted,  and given  salary  raises , to \\nincent ivize  all teachers  to do their best work.  Therefore,  a robust  merit -based  structure  of tenure , \\npromotion,  and salary  structure  will be developed,  with multiple  levels  within  each teacher  stage,  that \\nincentivizes  and recognizes  outstanding  teachers . A syste m of multiple  parameters  for proper  \\nassessment  of performance  will be developed  for the same  by State/UT  Governments  that is based  on \\npeer reviews,  attendance,  commitment,  hours  of CPD,  and other  forms  of service  to the school  and \\nthe community  or based  on NPST  given  in Para 5.20.  In this Policy,  in the context  of careers,  ‘tenure’ \\nrefers  to confirmation  for permanent  employment,  after due assessment  of performance  and \\ncontribution,  while  ‘tenure  track ’ refers  to the period  of probation  preceding  tenure.  \\n5.18. Further,  it will be ensured  that career  growth  (in terms  of tenure,  promotions,  salary  increases,  \\netc.) is available  to teachers  within  a single  school  stage  (i.e., Foundational,  Preparatory,  Middle,  or \\nSecondary),  and that there  is no career  progressi on-related  incentive  to move  from  being  teachers  in \\nearly  stages  to later stages  or vice versa  (though  such career  moves  across  stages  will be allowed,  \\nprovided  the teacher  has the desire  and qualifications  for such a move).  This is to support  the fact that \\nall stages  of school  education  will require  the highest -quality  teachers,  and no stage  will be \\nconsidered  more  important  than any other.  \\n5.19.  Vertical  mobility  of teachers  based  on merit  will also be paramount;  outstanding  teachers  with \\ndemonst rated  leadership  and management  skills  would  be trained  over time to take on academic  \\nleadership  positions  in schools,  school  complexes,  BRCs,  CRCs,  BITEs,  DIETs  as well as relevant  \\ngovernment  departments.  \\nProfessional  Standards  for Teachers  \\n5.20.  A common  guiding  set of National  Professional  Standards  for Teachers  (NPST)  will be \\ndeveloped  by 2022,  by the National  Council  for Teacher  Education  in its restructured  new form  as a \\nProfessional  Standard  Setting  Body (PSSB)  under  the General  Education  Council  (GEC), in \\nconsultation  with NCERT , SCERTs,  teachers  from  across  levels  and regions,  expert  organi zations  in \\nteacher  preparation  and development,  expert  bodies  in vocational  education,  and higher  education  \\ninstitutions.  The standards  would  cover  expectations  of the role of the teacher  at different  levels  of \\nexpertise/ stage , and the competencies  required  for that stage .

The NPST  will \\nalso inform the design  of pre-service  teacher  education  programmes.  This could  be then adopted  by \\nStates  and determine  all aspects  of teacher  career  management,  including  tenure , professional  \\ndevelopment  efforts,  salary  increases,  promotions,  and other  recognition s. Promot ions and salary  \\nincreases  will not occur  based  on the length  of tenure  or seniority,  but only on the basis  of such \\nappraisal.  The professional  standards  will be reviewed  and revised  in 2030,  and thereafter  every  ten \\nyears,  on the basis  of rigorous  empirica l analysis  of the efficacy  of the system.   \\nSpecial  educators   \\n5.21.  There  is an urgent  need for additional  special  educators  for certain  areas  of school  education.  \\nSome  examples  of such specialist  requirements  include  subject  teaching  for children  with \\ndisabilities/ Divyang  children  at the Middle  and Secondary  school  level,  including  teaching  for \\nspecific  learning  disabilities.  Such  teachers  would  require  not only subject -teaching  knowledge  and \\nunderstanding  of subject -related  aims  of educat ion, but also the relevant  skills  for understanding  of \\nspecial  requirements  of children.  Therefore,  such areas  could  be developed  as secondary  \\nspecializations  for subject  teachers  or generalist  teachers,  during  or after pre-service  teacher  \\npreparation.  They will be offered  as certificate  courses,  in the pre-service  as well as in-service  mode,  \\neither  full time or as part-time/blended  courses  - again,  necessarily,  at multidisciplinary  colleges  or \\nuniversities.  Greater  synergy  will be enabled  between  the cours e curriculum  of NCTE  and RCI to \\nensure  adequate  availability  of qualified  special  educators  who can handle  subject  teaching  as well.  \\nApproach  to Teacher  Education  \\n5.22.  Recognizing  that the teachers  will require  training  in high-quality  content  as well as pedagogy,  \\nteacher  education  will gradually  be moved  by 2030  into multidisciplinary  colleges  and universities.  \\nAs colleges  and universities  all move  towards  becoming  multidisciplinary,  they will also aim to \\nhouse  outstanding  education  departments  that offer  B.Ed.,  M.Ed.,  and Ph.D.  degrees  in education.  \\n5.23.  By 2030,  the minimum  degree  qualification  for teaching  will be a 4-year integrated  B.Ed.  \\ndegree  that teaches  a range  of knowledge  content  and pedagogy  and includes  strong  practicum  \\ntraining  in the form  of student -teachin g at local  schools.  The 2-year B.Ed.  programmes  will also be \\noffered,  by the same  multidisciplinary  institutions  offering  the 4-year integrated  B.Ed.,  and will be \\nintended  only for those  who have  already  obtained  Bachelor  ’s Degrees  in other  specialized  subjects.  \\nThese  B.Ed.  programmes  may also be suitably  adapted  as 1-year B.Ed.  programmes,  and will be \\noffered  only to those  who have  completed  the equivalent  of   4-year multidisciplinary  Bachelor  ’s \\nDegrees  or who have  obtain ed a Master ’s degree  in a specialt y and wish  to become  a subject  teacher  \\nin that specialty . All such B.Ed.  degrees  would  be offered  only by accredited  multidisciplinary  higher  \\neducation  institutions  offering  4-year integrated  B.Ed.  programmes.  Multidiscipl inary  higher  \\neducation  institution s offering  the 4-year in-class  integrated  B.Ed.  programme  and having  \\naccreditation  for ODL  may also offer  high-quality  B.Ed.  programmes  in blended  or ODL  mode  to \\nstudents  in remote  or difficult -to-access  locations  and also to in-service  teachers  who are aiming  to \\nenhance  their qualification , with suitable  robust  arrangements  for mentoring  and for the practicum -\\ntraining  and student -teaching  components  of the programme.   \\n5.24.  All B.Ed.  programmes  will include  training  in time-tested  as well as the most  recen t techniques  \\nin pedagogy,  including  pedagogy  with respect  to foundational  literacy  and numeracy,  multi -level  \\nteaching  and evaluation,  teaching  children  with disabilities,  teaching  children  with special  interests  or \\ntalents , use of educational  technology,  and learner -centered and collaborative  learning.  All B.Ed.  \\nprogrammes  will include  strong  practicum  training  in the form  of in-classroom  teaching  at local  \\nschools.  All B.Ed.  programmes  will also emphasi ze the practice  of the Fundamental  Duties  (Article  \\n51A)  of the Indian  Constitution  along  with other  Constitutional  provisions  while  teaching  any subject  \\nor performing  any activity.

Shorter  post-B.Ed.  certification  courses  will also be made  widely  available,  at multidisciplinary  \\ncolleges  and universities,  to teachers  who may wish  to move  into more  specialized  areas  of teaching,  \\nsuch as the teaching  of students  with disabilities,  or into leadership  and manage ment  positions  in the \\nschooling  system,  or to move  from  one stage  to another  between  foundational,  preparatory,  middle , \\nand secondary  stages.  \\n5.27.  It is recognized  that there  may be several  pedagogical  approaches  internationally  for teaching  \\nparticular  subjects;  NCERT  will study,  research,  document,  and compile  the varied  international  \\npedagogical  approaches  for teaching  different  subjects  and make  recommendations  on what  can be \\nlearnt  and assimilated  from  these  approaches  into the pedagogies  being  practi ced in India.  \\n5.28.  By 2021,  a new and comprehensive  Nationa l Curriculum  Framework  for Teacher  Education,  \\nNCFTE  2021,  will be formulated  by the NCTE  in consultation  with NCERT,  based  on the principles  \\nof this National  Education  Policy  2020 . The framework  will be developed  after discussions  with all \\nstakeholders  including  State  Governments , relevant  Ministries/Departments  of Central  Government  \\nand various  expert  bodies,  and will be made  available  in all regional  languages.  The NCFTE  2021  \\nwill also factor  in the requirements  of teacher  education  curricula  for vocation al education.  The \\nNCFTE  will thereafter  be revised  once  every  5-10 years  by reflecting  the changes  in revised  NCFs  as \\nwell as emerging  needs  in teacher  education.   \\n5.29. Finally,  in order  to fully  restore  the integrity  of the teacher  education  system,  stringent  action  \\nwill be taken  against  substandard  stand -alone  Teacher  Education  Institutions  (TEIs)  running  in the \\ncountry , including  shutting  them  down , if required .  \\n6. Equitable  and Inclusive  Educa tion:  Learning  for All \\n6.1. Education  is the single  greates t tool for achieving  social  justice  and equality.  Inclusive  and \\nequitable  education  - while  indeed  an essential  goal in its own right  - is also critical  to achieving  an \\ninclusive  and equitable  society in which  every  citizen  has the opportunity  to dream,  thrive, and \\ncontribute  to the nation.  The education  system  must  aim to benefit  India  ’s children  so that no child  \\nloses  any opportunity  to learn  and excel  because  of circumstances  of birth  or backgrou nd. This Policy  \\nreaffirms  that bridging  the social  category  gaps in access,  participation,  and learning  outcomes  in \\nschool  education  will continue  to be one of the major  goals  of all education  sector  development  \\nprogramme s. This Chapter  may be read in conjunction  with Chapter  14 which  discusses  analogous  \\nissues  of Equity  and Inclusion  in Higher  Education . \\n6.2. While  the Indian  education  system  and successive  government  policies  have  made  steady  \\nprogress  towards  bridging  gender  and social  category  gaps in all levels  of school  education,  large  \\ndisparities  still remain  - especially  at the secondary  level  - particularly  for socio -economically  \\ndisadvantaged  groups  that have  been  historically  underrepresented  in education.  Socio -Economica lly \\nDisadvantaged  Groups  (SEDGs)  can be broadly  categorized  based  on gender  identities  (particularly  \\nfemale  and transgender  individuals),  socio -cultural  identities  (such  as Scheduled  Castes,  Scheduled  \\nTribes,  OBCs,  and minorities),  geographical  identities  (such  as students  from  villages,  small  towns,  \\nand aspirational  districts),  disabilities  (including  learning  disabilities),  and socio -economic  conditions  \\n(such  as migrant  communities,  low income  households,  children  in vulnerable  situations,  victims  of \\nor children  of victims  of trafficking,  orphans  including  child  beggars  in urban  areas,  and the urban  \\npoor).  While  overall  enrolments  in schools  decline  steadily  from  Grade  1 to Grade  12, this decline  in \\nenrolments  is significantly  more  pronounced  for many  of these SED Gs, with even greater  declines  for \\nfemale  students  within  each of these  SEDGs  and often  even  steeper  in higher  education.  A brief  \\nstatus  overview  of the SEDGs  that come  within  socio -cultural  identities  is given  in following  sub-\\nsections.

According  to U-DISE  2016 -17 data,  about  19.6%  of students  belong  to Scheduled  Castes  at the \\nprimary  level,  but this fraction  falls to 17.3% at the higher  secondary  level.  These  enrolment  drop-\\noffs are more  severe  for Scheduled  Tribes  students  (10.6%  to 6.8%) , and differently -abled  children  \\n(1.1%  to 0.25%),  with even  greater  declines  for female  students  within  each of these  categories.  The \\ndecline  in enrolment  in higher  education  is even  steeper.  \\n6.2.2 . A multiplicity  of factors,  including  lack of access  to quality schools,  poverty,  social  mores  & \\ncustoms,  and language  have  had a detrimental  effect  on rates  of enrolment  and retention  among  the \\nScheduled  Castes.  Bridging  these  gaps in access , participation,  and learning  outcomes  of children  \\nbelonging  to Schedule d Castes  will continue  to be one of the major  goals.  Also,  the Other  Backward  \\nClasses  (OBCs)  which  have  been  identified  on the basis  of historically  being  socially  and \\neducationally  backward  also need  special  focus.  \\n 6.2.3 . Tribal  communities  and children  from  Scheduled  Tribes  also face \\ndisadvantages  at multiple  levels  due to various  historical  and geographical  factors.  Children  from  \\ntribal  communities  often  find their school  education  irrelevant  and foreign  to their lives,  both \\nculturally  and academically.  While  several  programmatic  interventions  to uplift  children  from  tribal  \\ncommunities  are currently  in place,  and will continue  to be pursued,  special  mechan isms need  to be \\nmade  to ensure  that children  belonging  to tribal  communities  \\nreceive  the benefits  of these  interventions.    \\n6.2.4 . Minorities  are also relatively  underrepresented  in   school  and higher  education.  The Policy  \\nacknowledges  the importance  of interventions  to promote  education  of children  belonging  to all \\nminority  communities,  and particularl y those  communities  that are educationally  underrepresented . \\n 6.2.5 . The Policy  also recognizes  the importance  of creating  enabling  mechanisms  for providing  \\nChildren  With Special  Needs  (CWSN)  or Divyang , the same  opportunities  of obtaining  quality  \\neducatio n as any other  child.  \\n6.2.6 . Separate  strategies  will be formulated  for focused  attention  on reducing  the social  category  \\ngaps in school  education  as outlined  in the following  sub-sections.   \\n6.3. The critical  problems  and recommendations  regarding  ECCE,  foundational  literacy  and \\nnumeracy,  access , enrolment  and attendance  discussed  in Chapters  1–3, are particularly  relevant  and \\nimportant  for underrepresented  and disadvantaged  groups . Therefore , the measures  from  Chapters  1–\\n3 will be targeted  in a concerted  way for SEDGs.  \\n6.4. In addition,  there  have  been  various  successful  policies  and schemes  such as targeted  \\nscholarships,  conditional  cash transfers  to incentivize  parents  to send their children  to school,  \\nproviding  bicycles  for transport,  etc., that have  significantly  increased  participation  of SEDGs  in the \\nschooling  system  in certain  areas.  These  successful  policies  and schemes  must  be significantly  \\nstrengthened  across  the country.   \\n6.5. It will also be essential  to take into account  research  that ascertains  which  measures  are \\nparticularly  effective  for certain  SEDGs.  For example,  providing  bicycles  and organizing  cycling  and \\nwalking  groups  to provide  access  to school  have  been shown  to be particularly  powerful  methods  in \\nincreasing  participation  of female  students  - even  at lesser  distances  - because  of the safety  benefits  \\nand comfort  to parents  that they provide.  One-on-one teachers  and tutors,  peer tutoring,  open  \\nschooling,  appropriate  infrastructure,  and suitable  technological  interventions  to ensure  acces s can be \\nparticularly  effective  for certain  children  with disabilities.  Schools  providing  quality ECCE  reap the \\ngreatest  dividends  for children  who come  from  families  that are economically  disadvantaged.  \\nMeanwhile,  counsellors  and/or  well-trained  social  workers  that work  with and connect  with students,  \\nparents,  schools,  and teachers  in order  to improve  attendance  and learning  outcomes  have  been  found  \\nto be especially  effective  for children  in urban  poor areas.

Data  shows  that certain  geographical  areas  contain  significantly  larger  proportions  of SEDGs.  \\nAlso,  there  are geographical  locations  that have  been  identified  as Aspirational  Districts  which  \\nrequire  special  interventions  for promoting  their educational  development.  Hence,  it is recommended  \\nthat regions  of the country  with large  populations  from  educationally -disadvantaged  SEDGs  should  \\nbe declared  Special  Education  Zones  (SEZs),  where  all the schemes  and policies  are implemented  to \\nthe maximum  through  additional  concerted  efforts , in order  to truly  change  their educational  \\nlandscape.  \\n6.7. It must  be noted  that women  cut across  all underrepr esented  groups,  making  up about  half of all \\nSEDGs . Unfortunately , the exclusion  and inequity  that SEDGs  face is only amplified  for the women  \\nin these  SEDGs.  The policy additionally  recognizes  the special  and critical  role that women  play in \\nsociety  and in shaping  social  mores;  therefore,  providing  a quality  education  to girls is the best way to \\nincrease  the education  levels  for these  SEDGs,  not just in the present  but also in future  generation s. \\nThe policy  thus recommends  that the policies  and schemes  designed  to include  students  from  SEDGs  \\nshould  be especially  targeted  towards  girls in these  SEDGs.  \\n6.8. In addition,  the Government  of India  will constitute  a ‘Gender -Inclusion  Fund’ to build  the \\nnation  ’s capacity  to provide  equitable  quality  education  for all girls as well as transgender  students.  \\nThe fund will be available  to States  to implement  priorities  determined  by the Central  government  \\ncritical  for assisting  female  and transgender  childre n in gaining  access  to education  (such  as the \\nprovisions  of sanitation  and toilets,  bicycles,  conditional  cash transfers,  etc.);  funds  will also enable  \\nStates to support  and scale  effective  community -based  interventions  that address local  context -\\nspecific  barriers  to female  and transgender  children ’s access  to and participation  in education.  Similar  \\n‘Inclusion  Fund’ schemes  shall  also be developed  to address  analogous  access  issues  for other  \\nSEDGs.  In essence,  this Policy  aims  to eliminate  any remaining  disparity  in access  to education  \\n(including  vocational  education)  for children  from  any gender  or other  socio -economically  \\ndisadvantaged  group.  \\n6.9. Free boarding  facilities  will be built - matching  the standard  of Jawahar  Navodaya  Vidyalayas  - \\nin school  locations  where  students  may have  to come  from  far, and particularly  for students  who from  \\nsocio -economically  disadvantaged  backgrounds,  with suitable  arrangements  for the safety  of all \\nchildren,  especially  girls. Kasturba  Gandhi  Balika Vidyalayas  will be strengthened  and expanded  to \\nincrease  the participation  in quality  schools  (up to Grade  12) of girls from  socio -economically  \\ndisadvantaged  backgrounds.  Additional  Jawahar  Navodaya  Vidyalayas  and Kendriya  Vidyalayas  will \\nbe built around the country,  especially  in aspirational  districts,  Special  Education  Zones,  and other  \\ndisadvantaged  areas,  to increase  high-quality  educational  opportunities . Pre-school  sections  covering  \\nat least one year of early  childhood  care and education  will be added  to Kendriya  Vidyalayas  and \\nother  primary  schools  around  the nation,  particularly  in disadvantaged  areas.  \\n6.10.  Ensuring  the inclusion  and equal  participation  of children  with disabilities  in ECCE  and the \\nschooling  system  will also be accorded  the highest priority.  Children  with disabilities  will be enabled  \\nto fully  participate  in the regular  schooling  process  from  the Foundational  Stage  to higher  education.  \\nThe Rights  of Persons  with Disabilities  (RPWD)  Act 2016  defines  inclusive  education  as a ‘system of \\neducation  wherein  students  with and without  disabilities  learn  together  and the system  of teaching  \\nand learning  is suitably  adapted  to meet  the learning  needs  of different  types  of students  with \\ndisabilities’ . This Policy  is in complete  consonance  with the provisions  of the RPWD  Act 2016  and \\nendorses  all its recommendations  with regard  to school  education.  While  preparing  the National  \\nCurriculum  Framework,  NCERT  will ensure  that consultations  are held with expert  bodies  such as \\nNational  Institutes  of DEPwD.   \\n6.11.  To this end, schools/school  complexes  will be provided  resources  for the integration  of children  \\nwith disabilities,  recruitment  of special  educators  with cross -disability  training,  and for the \\nestablishment  of resource  centres,  wherever  needed , especially  for children  with severe  or multiple  \\ndisabilities.  Barrier  free access  for all children  with disabilities  will be enabled  as per the RPWD  Act. \\nDifferent  categories  of children  with disabilities  have  differing  needs .

In particular,  assistive  devices  and appropriate technology -based  tools,  as well as adequate  \\nand language -appropriate  teaching -learning  materials  (e.g.,  textbooks  in accessible  formats  such as \\nlarge  print  and Braille)  will be made  available  to help children  with disabilities  integrate  more  easily \\ninto classrooms  and engage  with teachers  and their peers.  This will apply  to all school  activities  \\nincluding  arts, sports,  and vocational  education.  NIOS  will develop  high-quality  modules  to teach  \\nIndian  Sign Language,  and to teach  other  basic  subjects  using Indian  Sign Language.  Adequate  \\nattention  will be paid to the safety  and security  of children  with disabilities.    \\n6.12.  As per the RPWD  Act 2016,  children  with benchmark  disabilities  shall  have  the choice  of \\nregular  or special  schooling.  Resource  centres in conjunction  with special  educators  will support  the \\nrehabilitation  and educational  needs  of learners  with severe  or multiple  disabilities  and will assist  \\nparents/guardians  in achieving  high-quality  home  schooling  and skilling  for such students  as needed . \\nHome -based  education  will continue  to be a choice  available  for children  with severe  and profound  \\ndisabilities  who are unable  to go to schools.  The children  under  home -based  education  must  be \\ntreated  as equal  to any other  child  in the general  system.  There shall  be an audit  of home -based  \\neducation  for its efficiency  and effectiveness  using  the principle  of equity  and equality  of \\nopportunity.  Guidelines  and standards  for home -based  schooling  shall  be developed  based  on this \\naudit  in line with the RPWD  Act 2016.  While  it is clear  that the education  of all children  with \\ndisabilities  is the responsibility  of the State,  technology -based  solutions  will be used for the \\norientation  of parents/caregivers  along  with wide -scale  dissemination  of learning  materials  to enable  \\nparents/caregivers  to actively  support  their children’s  learning  needs  will be accorded  priority.   \\n6.13.  Most  classrooms  have children  with specific  learning  disabilities  who need continuous  support.  \\nResearch  is clear  that the earlier  such suppo rt begins,  the better  the chances  of progress.  Teachers  \\nmust  be helped  to identify  such learning  disabilities  early  and plan specifically  for their mitigation.  \\nSpecific  actions  will include  the use of appropriate  technology  allowing  and enabling  children  to \\nwork at their own pace,  with flexible  curricula  to leverage  each child’s  strengths,  and creating  an \\necosystem  for appropriate  assessment  and certification.  Assessment  and certification  agencies,  \\nincluding  the proposed  new National  Assessment  Centre,  PARAKH , will formulate  guidelines  and \\nrecommend  appropriate  tools  for conducting  such assessment,  from  the foundational  stage  to higher  \\neducation  (including  for entrance  exams),  in order  to ensure  equitable  access  and opportunit ies for all \\nstudents  with learning  disabilities.  \\n6.14.  The awareness  and knowledge  of how to teach  children  with specific  disabilities  (including  \\nlearning  disabilities)  will be an integral  part of all teacher  education  programmes,  along  with gender  \\nsensiti zation  and sensiti zation  towards  all underrepresented  groups  in order  to reverse  their \\nunderrepresentation . \\n6.15.  Alternative  forms  of schools,  will be encouraged  to preserve  their traditions  or alternative  \\npedagogical  styles . At the same  time, they will be supported  to integrate  the subject  and learning  \\nareas  prescribed  by the NCFSE  into their curricula  in order  to reduce  and eventually  eliminate  the \\nunderrepresentation  of children  from  these  schools  in higher  education.  In particular,  financial  \\nassistance  will be provided  to introduce  scien ce, mathematics,  social  studies,  Hindi,  English,  State  \\nlanguages,  or other  relevant  subjects  in the curriculum,  as may be desired  by these  schools.  This \\nwould  enable  children  studying  in these  schools  to attain  the learn ing outcomes  defined  for Grades  1–\\n12. Furthermore,  students  in such schools  would  be encouraged  to appear  for State  or other  Board  \\nexaminations  and assessments  by the NTA , and thereby  enroll  in higher  education  institutions.  \\nCapacities  of teachers  in the teaching  of science,  mathematics,  language,  and social  studies  will be \\ndeveloped  including  orientation  to new pedagogical  practices.

Under  the aegis  of the Ministry  of Defence,  State  Governments  may encourage  opening  NCC  \\nwings  in their secondary  and higher  secondary  schools,  including  those  located  in tribal  domin ated \\nareas.  This will enable  harnessing  of the natural  talent  and unique  potential  of students,  which  in turn \\nwould  help them  to aspire  to a successful  career  in the defence  forces.  \\n6.18. All scholarships  and other  opportunities  and schemes  available  to students  from  SEDGs  will be \\ncoordinated  and announced  by a single  agency  and website  to ensure  that all students  are aware  of, \\nand may apply  in a simplified  manner  on such a ‘single  window  system ’, as per eligibility . \\n6.19. All the above  policies  and measure s are absolutely  critical  to attaining  full inclusion  and equity  \\nfor all SEDGs  - but they are not sufficient.  What  is also required  is a change  in school  culture.  All \\nparticipants  in the school  education  system,  including  teachers,  principals,  administrato rs, \\ncounsellors,  and students,  will be sensitized  to the requirements  of all students,  the notions  of \\ninclusion  and equity,  and the respect,  dignity,  and privacy  of all persons.  Such an educational  culture  \\nwill provide  the best pathway  to help students  become empowered  individuals  who,  in turn, will \\nenable  society  to transform  into one that is responsible  towards  its most  vulnerable  citizens.  Inclusion  \\nand equity  will become  a key aspect  of teacher  education  (and training  for all leadership,  \\nadministrative,  and other  positions  in schools);  efforts  will be made  to recruit  more  high-quality  \\nteachers  and leaders  from  SEDGs  in order  to bring  in excellent  role models  for all students.  \\n6.20. Students  will be sensitized  through  this new school  culture,  brought  in by teachers,  trained  \\nsocial  workers  and counsellors  as well as through  corresponding  changes  to bring  in an inclusive  \\nschool  curriculum.  The school  curriculum  will include,  early  on, material  on human  values  such as \\nrespect  for all persons,  empathy,  toleran ce, human  rights,  gender  equality,  non-violence,  global  \\ncitizenship,  inclusion,  and equity.  It would  also include  more  detailed  knowledge  of various  cultures,  \\nreligions,  languages,  gender  identities,  etc. to sensitize  and develop  respect  for diversity.  Any biases  \\nand stereotypes  in school  curriculum  will be removed,  and more  material  will be included  that is \\nrelevant  and relatable  to all communities.  \\n7. Efficient  Resourcing  and Effective  Governance  through  School  Complexes/Clusters  \\n7.1. While  the establishm ent of primary  schools  in every  habitation  across  the country -driven  by the \\nSarva  Shiksha  Abhiyan  (SSA) , now subsumed  under  the Samagra  Shiksha  Scheme  and other  \\nimportant  efforts  across  the States - has helped  to ensure  near-universal  access  to primary  schools,  it \\nhas also led to the development  of numerous  very small  schools.  According  to U-DISE  2016–17 data,  \\nnearly  28% of India ’s public  primary  school s and 14.8%  of India  ’s upper  primary  schools  have  less \\nthan 30 students.  The average  number  of students  per grade  in the elementary  schooling  system  \\n(primary  and upper  primary,  i.e., Grades  1–8) is about  14, with a notable  proportion  having  below  6; \\nduring  the year 2016–17, there  were  1,08,017  single -teacher  schools,  the majority  of them  (85743  ) \\nbeing  primary  schools  serving  Grades  1–5. \\n7.2. These  small  school  sizes  have  rendered  it economically  suboptimal  and operationally  complex  to \\nrun good  schools,  in terms  of deployment  of teachers  as well as the provision  of critical  physical  \\nresources.  Teachers  often   teach multiple  grades  at a time,  and teach  multiple  subjects,  including  \\nsubjects  in which  they may have  no prior  background;  key areas  such as music,  arts, and sports  are \\ntoo often  simply  not taught;  and physical  resources,  such as lab and sports  equipment  and library  \\nbooks,  are simply  not available  across  schools.  \\n7.3. The isolation  of small  schools  also has a negative  effect  on education  and the teachi ng-learning  \\nprocess.  Teachers  function  best in communities  and teams,  and so do students.  Small  schools  also \\npresent  a systemic  challenge  for governance  and management.  The geographical  dispersion,  \\nchallenging  access  conditions,  and the very large  numbers  of schools  make  it difficult  to reach  all \\nschools  equally.  Administrative  structures  have  not been aligned   with the increases  in the number  of \\nschool  or  with the unified  structure  of the Samagra  Shiksha  Scheme .

Although  consolidation  of schools  is an option  that is often  discussed,  it must  be carried  out very \\njudiciously,  and only when  it is ensured  that there  is no impact  on access . Such  measures  are \\nnevertheless  likely  to result  only in limited  consolidation,  and would  not solve  the overall  structu ral \\nproblem  and challenges  presented  by the large  numbers  of small  schools.  \\n7.5. These  challenges  will, by 2025,  be addressed  by State/UT  governments  by adopting  innovative  \\nmechanisms  to group  or rationalize  schools.  The objective  behind  this intervention  would  be to \\nensure  that every  school  has: (a) adequate  number  of counsellors/trained  social  workers  and teachers  \\n(shared  or otherwise)  for teaching  all subjects  including  art, music  science,  sports,  languages,  \\nvocational  subjects,  etc; (b) adequate  resourc es (shared  or otherwise),  such as a library,  science  labs, \\ncomputer  labs, skill labs, playgrounds,  sports  equipment  and facilities,  etc.; (c) a sense  of community  \\nis built to overcome  the isolation  of teachers,  students,  and schools,  through  joint professional  \\ndevelopment  programmes,  sharing  of teaching -learning  content,  joint content  development,  holding  \\njoint activities  such as art and science  exhibitions,  sports  meets,  quizzes  and debates,  and fairs;   (d) \\ncooperation  and support  across  schools  for the education  of children  with disabilities;  and (e) \\nimproved  governance  of the schooling  system  by devolving  all finer  decisions,  to Principals,  teachers,  \\nand other  stakeholders  within  each group  of schools  and treating  such a group  of schools,  which  \\nrange from  the foundational  stage  through  the secondary  stage,  as an integrated  semi -autonomous  \\nunit.  \\n7.6. One possible mechanism  for accomplishing  the above  would  be the establishment  of a grouping  \\nstructure  called  the school  complex,  consisting  of one secondary  school  together  with all other  \\nschools  offering  lower  grades  in its neighbourhood  including  Anganwadis,  in a radius  of five to ten \\nkilometers . This suggestion  was first made  by the Education  Commission  (1964–66) but was left \\nunimplemented.  This Policy strongly  endorses  the idea of the school  complex/cluster,  wherever  \\npossible.  The aim of the school  complex/clus ter will be greater  resource  efficiency  and more  effective  \\nfunctioning,  coordination,  leadership,  governance,  and management  of schools  in the cluster.  \\n7.7. The establishment  of school  complexes/clusters  and the sharing  of resources  across  complexes  \\nwill have a number  of other  benefits  as a consequence,  such as improved  support  for children  with \\ndisabilities,  more  topic -centred  clubs  and academi c/sports/arts/crafts  events  across  school  complexes,  \\nbetter  incorporation  of art, music,  language,  vocational  subjects, physical  education,  and other  \\nsubjects  in the classroom  through  the sharing  of teachers  in these  subjects  including   use of ICT tools  \\nto conduct  virtual  classes,  better  student  support,  enrolment,  attendance,  and performance  through  the \\nsharing  of social workers  and counsellors,  and School  Complex  Management  Committees  (rather  \\nthan simply  School  Management  Committees)  for more  robust  and improved  governance,  \\nmonitoring,  oversight,  innovations,  and initiatives  by local  stakeholders.  Building  such large r \\ncommunities  of schools,  school  leaders,  teachers,  students,  supporting  staff,  parents,  and local  \\ncitizens  would  energize  and empower  the schooling  system,  and in a resource -efficient  manner.  \\n7.8. The governance  of schools  will also improve  and become  far more  efficient  with school  \\ncomplexes/clusters.  First,  the DSE  will devolve  authority  to the school  complex/cluster,  which  will \\nact as a semi -autonomous  unit. The District  Education  Officer  (DEO)  and the Block  Education  \\nOfficers  (BEO)  will interact  primari ly with each school  complex/cluster  as a single  unit and facilitate  \\nits work.  The complex  itself  will perform  certain  tasks  delegated  by the DSE and will deal with the \\nindividual  schools  within  it. The school  complex/cluster  will be given  significant  auton omy by the \\nDSE  to innovate  towards  providing  integrated  education  and to experiment  with pedagogies,  \\ncurriculum,  etc., while  adhering  to the National  Curricular  Framework  (NCF)  and State  Curricular  \\nFramework  (SCF).  Under  this organization , schools  will gain in strength,  will be able to exercise  \\ngreater  freedom,  and will contribute  towards  making  the complex  more  innovative  and responsive.  \\nMeanwh ile, the DSE  will be able to focus  on the aggregate  level  goals  that need  to be achieved,  \\nimproving  overall  system  effectiveness.  \\n7.9. The culture  of working  to a plan,  both short -term and long-term ones,  will be developed  through  \\nsuch complexes/clusters.  Schools  will develop  their plans  (SDPs)  with the involvement  of their \\nSMCs.  These  plans  will then become  the basis  for the creation  of School  Complex/Cluster  \\nDevelopment  Plans  (SCDPs).

The DSE,  through  its relevant  official,  e.g., \\nthe BEO,  will endorse  and confirm  the SCDP  of each school  complex.  It will then provide  the \\nresources  (financial,  human,  physical,  etc.) necessary  to achieve  the SCDPs,  both short -term (1-year)  \\nand long-term (3-5 years).  It will also provide  all other  relevant  support  to the schoo l complexes  to \\nachieve  the educational  outcomes.  The DSE  and the SCERT  may share  specific  norms  (e.g.,  \\nfinancial,  staffing,  process)  and frameworks  for development  of the SDP and SCDP  with all schools,  \\nwhich  may be revised  periodically .  \\n7.10. To further  enhance  cooperation  and positive  synergy  among  schools,  including  between  public  \\nand private  schools,  the twinning/pairing  of one public  school  with one private  school  will be adopted  \\nacross  the country,  so that such paired  schools  may meet/interact  with each other,  learn  from  each \\nother,  and also share  resources,  if possible.  Best practices  of private  schools  will be documented,  \\nshared,  and institutionalized  in public  schools,  and vice versa,  where  possible.   \\n7.11. Every  State  will be encouraged  to strength en existing  or establish  “Bal Bhavans”  where  \\nchildren  of all ages can visit once  a week  (e.g.,  on weekends)  or more  often,  as a special  daytime  \\nboarding  school,  to partake  in art-related,  career -related,  and play-related  activities.  Such Bal \\nBhavans  may be incorporated  as a part of school  complexes/clusters  if possible.   \\n7.12. The school  should  be a point  of celebration  and honour  for the whole  community.  The dignity  \\nof the school  as an institution  should  be restored  and important  dates , such as the foundat ion day of \\nthe school,  will be celebrated  along  with the community  and the list of important  alumni  may be \\ndisplayed  and honoured.  Furthermore,  the un-utilized  capacity  of school  infrastructure  could  be used \\nto promote  social,  intellec tual, and volunteer  activities  for the community  and to promote  social  \\ncohesion  during  non-teaching  / schooling  hours  and may be used as a “Samajik  Chetna  Kendra”.  \\n8. Standard -setting  and Accreditation  for School  Education  \\n8.1. The goal of the school  educa tion regulatory  system  must  be to continually  improve  educational  \\noutcomes;  it must  not overly  restrict  schools,  prevent  innovation,  or demoralize  teachers,  principals,  \\nand students.  All in all, regulation  must  aim to empow er schools  and teachers  with trust, enabling  \\nthem  to strive  for excellence  and perform  at their very best, while  ensuring  the integrity  of the system  \\nthrough  the enforcement  of complete  transparency  and full public  disclosure  of all finances,  \\nprocedures,  and educational  outcomes.  \\n8.2. At present,  all main  functions  of governance  and regulation  of the school  education  system  - \\nnamely,  the provision  of public  education,  the regulation  of education  institutions,  and policymaking  \\n- are handled  by a single  body,  i.e., the Department  of School  Education  or its arms.  This leads  to \\nconflict  of interests  and excessive  centralized  concentration  of power;  it also leads  to ineffective  \\nmanagement  of the school  system,  as efforts  towards  quality  educational  provision  are often  diluted  \\nby the focus  on the other  roles,  particularly  regulation,  that the Departments  of School  Education  also \\nperform.  \\n8.3. The current  regulatory  regime  also has not been  able to curb the commerciali zation  and economic  \\nexploitation  of parents  by many for-profit  private  schools,  yet at the same  time it has all too often  \\ninadvertently  discouraged  public -spirited  private/philanthropic  schools.  There  has been far too much  \\nasymmetry  between  the regulatory  approaches  to public  and private  schools,  even  though  the goals  of \\nboth types  of schools  should  be the same:  to provide  quality  education.

The public  education  system  is the foundation  of a vibrant  democratic  society,  and the way it is \\nrun must  be transformed  and invigorated  in order  to achieve  the highest  levels  of educational  \\noutcomes  for the nation.  At the same  time,  the private/philanthropic  school  sector  must  also be \\nencouraged  and enabled  to play a significant  and beneficial  role. \\n8.5. The key principles  and recommendations  of this Policy  regarding  the State  school  education  \\nsystem,  the independent  responsibilities  within  that system,  and the approach  to its regulation  are as \\nfollows : \\n(a) The Department  of School  Education,  which  is the apex state-level  body  in school  education,  \\nwill be responsible  for overall  monitoring  and polic ymaking  for continual  improvement  of \\nthe public  education  system;  it will not be involved  with the provision  and operation  of \\nschools  or with the regulation  of schools,  in order  to ensure  due focus  on the improvement  of \\npublic  schools  and to eliminate  conflict of interests . \\n(b) The educational  operations  and service  provision  for the public  schooling  system  of the \\nwhole  State  will be handled  by the Directorate  of School  Education  (including  the offices  of \\nthe DEO  and BEO,  etc.);  it will work  independently  to implement  policies  regarding  \\neducational  operations  and provision.  \\n(c) An effective  quality  self-regulation  or accreditation  system  will be instituted  for all stages  of \\neducation  including  pre-school  education  - private,  public,  and philanthropic  - to ensure  \\ncompliance  with essential  quality  standards.  To ensure  that all schools follow  certain  minimal  \\nprofessional  and quality  standards,  States/UTs  will set up an independent,  State -wide,  body  \\ncalled  the State  School  Standards  Authority  (SSSA ). The SSSA  will establ ish a minimal  set \\nof standards  based  on basic  parameters  (namely,  safety,  security,  basic  infrastructure,  number  \\nof teachers  across  subjects  and grades,  financial  probity,  and sound  processes  of governance),  \\nwhich  shall  be followed  by all schools.  The fram ework  for these  parameters  will be created  \\nby the SCERT  in consul tation  with various  stakeholders,  especially  teachers  and schools.   \\nTransparent  public  self-disclosure  of all the basic  regulatory  information,  as laid down  by the \\nSSSA,  will be used extensiv ely for public  oversight  and accountability.  The dimensions  on \\nwhich information  has to be self-disclosed,  and the format  of disclosure  will be decided  by \\nthe SSSA  in accordance  with global  best practices  for standard -setting  for schools.  This \\ninformation  will have  to be made  available  and kept updated  and accurate  by all schools,  on \\nthe aforementioned  public  website  maintained  by the SSSA  and on the schools ’ websites . \\nAny complaints  or grievances  from  stakeholders  or others  arising  out of the information  \\nplaced  in the public  domain  shall  be adjudicated  by the SSSA.  Feed back  from  randomly  \\nselected  students  will be solicited  online  to ensure  valuable  input  at regular  intervals.  \\nTechnology  will be employed  suitably  to ensure efficiency  and transpare ncy in all work  of \\nthe SSSA . This will bring  down  significantly  the heavy  load of regulatory  mandates  currently  \\nborne  by schools . \\n(d) Academic  matters,  including  academic  standards  and curricula  in the State  will be led by the \\nSCER T (with  close  consultation  and collaboration  with the NCERT),  which will be \\nreinvigorated  as an institution . The SCERT  will develop  a School  Quality  Assessment  and \\nAccreditation  Framework  (SQAAF)  through  wide  consultations  with all stakeholders.  The \\nSCERT  will also lead a “change  management  process”  for the reinvigorati on of CRCs,  \\nBRCs,  and DIETs  which  must  change  the capacity  and work  culture  of these  institutions  in 3 \\nyears,  developing  them  into vibrant  institutions  of excellence.  Meanwhile,  certification  of \\ncompetencies  of students  at the school -leaving  stage  will be handled  by the Boards  of \\nAssessment /Examination  in each State.  \\n8.6. The culture,  structures,  and systems  that empower  and provide  adequate  resources  to schools,  \\ninstitutions,  teachers,  offici als, communities,  and other  stakeholders,  will also build  concomitant  \\naccountability.  Each  stakeholder  and participant  of the education  system  will be accountable  to \\nperform  their role with the highest  level  of integ rity, full commitment , and exemplary  work ethic.

It will have  multiple  sources  of feedback  \\nand assessment,  to ensure  a full view  of the performance  (and will not just be linked  simplistically,  \\ne.g., to ‘marks’  of students ). The assessment  will recognize  that outcomes  such as educational  \\nattainment  of students  have  multiple  intervening  variables  and extraneous  influences.  It will also \\nrecognize  that education  requires  teamwork , particularly  at the level  of the school.

This review  will aim to ensure  that all students,  particularly  \\nstude nts from  underprivileged  and disadvantaged  sections,  shall  have  unive rsal, free and compulsory  \\naccess  to high-quality  and equitable  schooling  from  early  childhood  care and education  (age 3 \\nonwards)  through  higher  secondary  education  (i.e., until Grade  12). The overemphasis  on inputs,  and \\nthe mechanistic  nature  of their specifications  – physical  and infrastructural  – will be changed  and \\nrequirements  made  more  responsive  to realities  on the ground,  e.g., regarding  land areas  and room  \\nsizes,  practicalities  of playgrounds  in urban  areas,  etc. These  mandates  will be adjusted  and loosened,  \\nleaving  suitable  flexibility  for each school  to make  its own decisions  based  on local  needs  and \\nconstraints,  while  ensuring  safety,  security,  and a pleasant  and productive  learn ing space.

Quality  Universities  and Colleges:  A New  and Forward -looking  Vision  for India ’s \\nHigher  Education  System  \\n9.1. Higher  education  plays  an extremely  important  role in promoting  human  as well as societal  well-\\nbeing  and in developing  India  as envisioned  in its Constitution  - a democratic,  just, socially -\\nconscious,  cultured,  and humane  nation  upholding  liberty,  equality,  fraternity , and justice  for all. \\nHigher  education  significantly  contributes  towards  sustai nable  livelihoods  and economic  \\ndevelopment  of the nation.  As India  moves  towards  becoming  a knowledge  economy  and society,  \\nmore  and more  young  Indians  are likely to aspire  for higher  education.   \\n9.1.1. Given  the 21st century  requirements , quality  higher  education  must  aim to develop  good,  \\nthoughtful,  well-rounded,  and creative  individuals.  It must  enable  an individual  to study  one or more  \\nspecialized  areas  of interest  at a deep  level,  and  also  develop  character,  ethical  and Constitutional  \\nvalues,  intellec tual curiosity,  scientific  temper,  creativity,  spirit  of service,  and 21st century  \\ncapabilities  across  a range  of disciplines  including  sciences,  social  sciences,  arts, humanities,  \\nlanguages,  as well as professional,  technical,  and vocational  subjects.  A quality  higher  education  \\nmust  enable  personal  accomplishment  and enlightenment,  constructive  public  engagement,  and \\nproductive  contribution  to the society.  It must  prepare  students  for more  meaningful  and satisfying  \\nlives  and work  roles  and enable  economic  independence.   \\n9.1.2.  For the purpose  of developing  holisti c individuals,  it is essential  that an identified  set of skills  \\nand values  will be incorporated  at each stage  of learning,  from  pre-school  to higher  education.  \\n9.1.3. At the societal  level , higher  education  must  enable  the development  of an enlightened,  socially  \\nconscious,  knowledgeable,  and skilled  nation  that can find and implement  robust  solutions  to its own \\nproblems.  Higher  education  must  form  the basis  for knowledge  creation  and innovation  thereby \\ncontributing  to a growing  national  economy.  The purpose  of quality  higher  education  is, therefore,  \\nmore  than the creation  of greater  opportunities  for individual  employment . It represents  the key to \\nmore  vibrant,  socially  engaged,  cooperative  communit ies and a happier,  cohesive,  cultured,  \\nproductive,  innovativ e, progressive,  and prosperous  nation.  \\n9.2. Some  of the major  problems  currently  faced  by the higher  education  system  in India  include:  \\n(a) a severely  fragmented  higher  educational  ecosystem ;  \\n(b) less emphasis  on the development  of cognitive  skills  and learning outcomes;  \\n(c) a rigid  separation  of disciplines,  with early  specialisation  and streaming  of students  into \\nnarrow  areas  of study;   \\n(d) limited  access  particularly  in socio -economically  disadvantaged  areas, with few HEIs  that \\nteach  in local  languages   \\n(e) limited  teacher  and institutional  autonomy;   \\n(f) inadequate  mechanisms  for merit -based  career  management  and progression  of faculty  and \\ninstitutional  leaders;   \\n(g) lesser  emphasis  on research  at most  universities  and colleges,  and lack of competitive  peer-\\nreviewed  research  funding  across  disciplines;   \\n(h) suboptimal  governance  and leadership  of HEIs;   \\n(i) an ineffective  regulatory  system ; and \\n(j) large  affiliating  universities  resulting  in low standards  of undergraduate  education.

This policy  envisions  a complete  overhaul  and re-energising  of the higher  education  system  to \\novercome  these  challenges  and thereby  deliver  high-quality  higher  educ ation,  with equity  and \\ninclusion .  The policy ’s vision  includes  the following  key chang es to the current  system:   \\n(a) moving  towards  a higher  educational  system  consisting  of large,  multidisciplinary  \\nuniversities  and colleges,  with at least one in or near every  district,  and with more  HEIs  \\nacross  India  that offer  medium  of instruction  or program mes in local/Indian  languag es;  \\n(b) moving  towards  a more  multidisciplinary  undergraduate  education;   \\n(c) moving  towards  faculty  and institutional  autonomy;   \\n(d) revamping  curriculum,  pedagogy,  assessment,  and student  support  for enhanced  student  \\nexperiences;   \\n(e) reaffir ming  the integrity  of facul ty and institutional  leadership  positions  through  merit -\\nappointments  and career  progression  based  on teaching,  research,  and service;   \\n(f) establishment  of a National  Research  Foundation  to fund outstanding  peer-reviewed  research  \\nand to actively  seed research  in universities  and colleges;   \\n(g) governance  of HEIs  by high qualified  independent  boards  having  academic  and \\nadministrative  autonomy;   \\n(h) “light but tight”  regulation  by a single  regulator  for higher  education ; \\n(i) increased  access,  equit y, and inclusion  through  a range  of measures,  including  greater  \\nopportunities  for outstanding  public  education;  scholarships  by private/philanthropic  \\nuniversities  for disadvantaged  and underprivileged  students ; online  education,  and Open  \\nDistance  Learning  (ODL);  and all infrastructure  and learning  materials  accessible  and \\navailable  to learners  with disabilities.   \\n \\n10. Institutional  Restructuring  and Consolidation  \\n10.1. The main  thrust  of this policy  regarding  higher  education  is to end the fragmentation  of higher  \\neducation  by transforming  higher  education  institutions  into large  multidisciplinary  universities,  \\ncolleges,  and HEI clusters/Knowledge  Hubs,  each of which  will aim to have  3,000  or more  students.  \\nThis would  help build  vibrant  communities  of scholar s and peers,  break  down  harmful  silos,  enable  \\nstudents  to become  well-rounded  across  disciplines  including  artistic,  creative,  and analytic  subjects  \\nas well as sports, develop  active  research  communities  across  disciplines  including  cross -disciplinary  \\nresearch, and increase  resource  efficiency,  both material  and human,  across  higher  education.  \\n10.2.  Moving  to large  multidisciplinary  universities  and HEI clusters  is thus the highest  \\nrecommendation  of this policy  regarding  the structure  of higher  education.  The ancient  Indian  \\nuniversities  Takshashila,  Nalanda,  Vallabhi,  and Vikramshila,  which  had thousands  of students  from  \\nIndia  and the world  studying  in vibrant  multi disciplinary  environments,  amply  demonstrated  the type \\nof great  success  that large  multidiscip linary  research  and teaching  universities  could  bring.  India  \\nurgently  needs  to bring  back  this great  Indian  tradition  to create  well-rounded  and innovative  \\nindividuals,  and which  is already  transforming  other  countries  educationally  and economically.  \\n10.3.  This vision  of higher  education  will require,  in particular,  a new conceptual  \\nperception/understanding  for what  constitutes  a higher  education  institution  (HEI),  i.e., a university  or \\na college.   A university  will mean  a multidisciplinary  institution  of higher  learning  that offers  \\nundergraduate  and graduate  programmes,  with high quality  teaching,  research,  and community  \\nengagement.  The definition  of university  will thus allow  a spectrum  of institutions  that range  from  \\nthose  that place  equal  emphasis  on teaching  and research  i.e., Research -intensive  Universities , those \\nthat place  greater  emphasis  on teaching  but still conduct  significant  research  i.e.  Teaching -intensive  \\nUniversities . Meanwhile,  an Autonomous  degree -granting  College  (AC)  will refer  to a large \\nmultidisciplinary  institution  of higher  learning  that grants  undergraduate  degrees  and is  primarily  \\nfocused  on undergraduate  teaching  though  it would  not be restricted  to that  and it need  not be \\nrestricted  to that and it would  generally  be smaller  than a typical  university.   \\n10.4.  A stage -wise mechanism  for granting  graded  autonomy  to colleges,  through  a transparent  \\nsystem  of graded  accreditation,  will be established.  Colleges  will be encouraged,  mentored,  \\nsupported,  and incentivized  to gradually  attain  the minimum  benchmarks  requir ed for each level  of ', metadata={'source': '/Users/anupam/Documents/Debtanaya docs/National_Education_Policy_2020.pdf', 'page': 34}),\n",

Over  a period  of time,  it is envisaged  that every  college  would  develop  into either  an \\nAutonomous  degree -granting  College,  or a constituent  college  of a university  - in the latter  case,  it \\nwould be fully  a part of the university.  With  appropriate  accreditations,  Autonomous  degree -granting  \\nColleges  could  evolve  into Research -intensive  or Teaching -intensive  Universities,  if they so aspire.  \\n10.5.  It must  be clearly  stated  that these  three  broad  types  of institutions  are not in any natural  way a \\nrigid , exclusionary  categorization , but are along  a continuum.  HEIs  will have the autonomy  and \\nfreedom  to move  gradually  from  one category  to another,  based  on their plans,  actions,  and \\neffectiveness.  The most  salient  marker  for these  categories  of institutions  will be the focus  of their \\ngoals  and work.  The Accreditation  System  will develop  and use appropriately  different  and relevant  \\nnorms  across  this range  of HEIs.  However,  the expectations  of high qualit y of education,  and of \\nteaching -learning,  across  all HEIs  will be the same.  \\n10.6.  In addition  to teaching  and research,  HEIs  will have  other  crucial  responsibilities,  which  they \\nwill discharge  through  appropriate  resourcing,  incentives,  and structures.   These include  supporting  \\nother  HEIs  in their development,  community  engagement  and service,  contribution  to various  fields  \\nof practice,  faculty  development  for the higher  education  system,  and support  to school  education.  \\n10.7.  By 2040,  all higher  education  instit utions  (HEIs)  shall  aim to become  multidisciplinary  \\ninstitutions  and shall  aim to have  larger  student  enrolments  preferably  in the thousands,  for optimal  \\nuse of infrastructure  and resources,  and for the creation  of vibrant  multidisciplinary  communiti es. \\nSince this process  will take time,  all HEIs  will firstly  plan to become  multidisciplinary  by 2030,  and \\nthen gradually  increase  student  strength  to the desired  levels.  \\n10.8.  More  HEIs  shall  be established  and developed  in underserved  regions  to ensure  full access,  \\nequity,  and inclusion.  There  shall,  by 2030,  be at least one large  multidisciplinary  HEI in or near \\nevery  district.  Steps  shall  be taken  towards  developing  high-quality  higher  education  institutions  both \\npublic  and private  that have medium  of instruc tion in local/Indian  languages  or bilingually . The aim \\nwill be to increase  the Gross  Enrolment  Ratio  in higher  education  including  vocational  education  \\nfrom  26.3%  (2018)  to 50% by 2035 . While  a number  of new institutions  may be developed  to attain  \\nthese goals, a large  part of the capacity  creation  will be achieved  by consolidating , substantially  \\nexpanding , and also improving  existing  HEIs.  \\n10.9.  Growth  will be in both public  and private  institutions,  with a strong  emphasis  on developing  a \\nlarge  number  of outstanding  public  institutions.  There  will be a fair and transparent  system  for \\ndetermining  increased  levels  of public  funding  support  for public  HEIs.  This system  will give an \\nequitable  opportunity  for all public  institutions  to grow  and develop,  and will be based  on transparent,  \\npre-announced  criteria  from  within  the accreditation  norms  of the Accreditation  System.  HEIs  \\ndelivering  education  of the highest  quality  as laid down  in this Policy  will be incentivi zed in \\nexpanding  their capacity . \\n10.10.  Institutions  will have  the option  to run Open  Distance  Learning  (ODL)  and online  \\nprogrammes,  provided  they are accredited  to do so, in order  to enhance  their offerings,  improve  \\naccess,  increase  GER,  and provide  opportun ities for lifelong  learning  (SDG  4). All ODL  programmes  \\nand their components  leading  to any diploma  or degree  will be of standards  and quality  equivalent  to \\nthe highest  quality  programmes  run by the HEIs  on their campuses.  Top institutions  accredited  for \\nODL will be encouraged  and supported  to develop  high-quality  online  courses.

University , worldwide,  means  a multidisciplinary  institution  of higher  learning  that offers  \\nundergraduate,  graduate,  and Ph.D  programmes,  and engages  in high-quality  teaching  and research.  \\nThe present  complex  nomenclature  of HEIs  in the country  such as ‘deemed  to be university’,  \\n‘affiliating  university’ , ‘affiliating  technical  university',  ‘unitary  university’  shall  be replaced  simply  \\nby 'university'  on fulfilling  the criteria  as per norms.  \\n11. Towards  a More  Holistic  and Multidisciplinary  Education  \\n11.1.  India  has a long tradition  of holistic  and multidisciplinary  learning,  from  universities  such as \\nTakshashila  and Nalanda,  to the extensive  literatures  of India  combining  subjects  across  fields.  \\nAncient  Indian  literary  works  such as Banabhatta’s  Kadambari  described  a good  education  as \\nknowledge  of the 64 Kalaas  or arts; and among  these  64 ‘arts’  were   not only subjects , such as \\nsinging  and painting,  but also ‘scientific   ’fields , such as chemistry  and mathematics , ‘vocational   ’\\nfields  such as carpentry  and clothes -making,  ‘professional   ’fields , such as medicine  and engineering,  \\nas well as  ‘soft skills’  such as communication,  discussion,  and debate.  The very idea that all \\nbranches  of creative  human  endeavour , includ ing mathematics,  science,  vocational  subjects,  \\nprofessional  subjects,  and soft skills  should  be considered  ‘arts’,  has distinctly  Indian  origins.  This \\nnotion  of a  ‘knowledge  of many  arts’ or what  in modern  times  is often  called  the ‘liberal  arts’  (i.e., a \\nliberal  notion  of the arts) must  be brought  back to Indian  education,  as it is exactly  the kind of \\neducation  that will be required  for the 21st century .  \\n11.2.  Assessments  of educational  approaches  in undergraduate  education  that integrate  the humanities  \\nand arts with Science,  Technology,  Engineering  and Mathematics  (STEM ) have consistently  showed  \\npositive  learning  outcomes,  including  increased  creativity  and innovation,  critical  thinking  and \\nhigher -order  thinking  capacities,  problem -solving  abilit ies, teamwork,  communication  skills,  more  in-\\ndepth  learning  and mastery  of curricula  across  fields,  increases  in social  and moral  awareness,  etc., \\nbesides  general  engagement  and enjoyment  of learning.  Research  is also improved  and enhanced  \\nthrough  a holist ic and multidisciplinary  education  approach.  \\n11.3.  A holistic  and multidisciplinary  education  would  aim to develop  all capacities  of human  beings  \\n-intellectual,  aesthetic,  social,  physical,  emotional,  and moral  in an integrated  manner.  Such  an \\neducation  will help develop  well-rounded  individuals  that possess  critical  21st century  capacitie s in \\nfields  across  the arts, humanities,  languages,  sciences,  social  sciences,  and professional,  technical,  \\nand vocational  fields;  an ethic  of social  engagement;  soft skills, such as communication,  discussion  \\nand debate;  and rigorous  specialization  in a chosen field or fields.  Such  a holistic  education  shall  be, \\nin the long term,  the approach  of all undergraduate  programmes,  including  those  in professional,  \\ntechnical,  and vocational  disciplines.  \", metadata={'source': '/Users/anupam/Documents/Debtanaya docs/National_Education_Policy_2020.pdf', 'page': 36}),\n",

A holistic  and multidisciplinary  education,  as described  so beautifully  in India  ’s past, is indeed  \\nwhat  is needed  for the education  of India  to lead the country  into the 21st century  and the fourth  \\nindustrial  revolution.  Even  engineering  institutions , such as IITs,  will move  towards  more  holistic  and \\nmultidisci plinary  education  with more  arts and humanities . Students  of arts and humanities  will aim \\nto learn  more  science  and all will make  an effort  to incorporate  more  vocational  subjects  and soft \\nskills.   \\n11.5.  Imaginative  and flexible  curricular  structures  will enable  creative  combinations  of disciplines  \\nfor study,  and would  offer  multiple  entry  and exit points,  thus, removing  currently  prevalent  rigid \\nboundaries  and creating  new possibilities  for life-long learning.  Graduate -level , master ’s and doctoral  \\neducatio n in large  multidisciplinary  universities,  while  providing  rigorous  research -based  \\nspecialization , would  also provide  opportunities  for multidisciplinary  work,  including  in academia,  \\ngovernment,  and industry.  \\n11.6.  Large  multidisciplinary  universities  and colleges  will facilitate  the move  towards  high-quality  \\nholistic  and multidisciplinary  education.  Flexibility  in curriculum  and novel  and engaging  course  \\noptions  will be on offer  to students,  in addition  to rigorous  specialization  in a subject  or subjects.  This \\nwill be encouraged  by increased  facult y and institutional  autonomy  in setting  curricula.

Departments  in Languages,  Literature,  Music,  Philosophy,  Indology,  Art, Dance,  Theatre,  \\nEducation,  Mathematics,  Statistics,  Pure and Applied  Sciences,  Sociology,  Economics,  Sports,  \\nTranslation  and Interpretation,  and other  such subjects  needed  for a multidisciplinary,  stimulating  \\nIndian  educa tion and environment  will be established  and strengthened  at all HEIs . Credits  will be \\ngiven  in all Bachelor’s Degree  programmes  for these  subjects  if they are done  from  such departments  \\nor through  ODL  mode  when  they are not offered  in-class  at the HEI.  \\n11.8. Towards  the attainment  of such a holistic  and multidisciplinary  education,  the flexible  and \\ninnovative  curricula  of all HEIs shall  include  credit -based  courses  and projects  in the areas  of \\ncommunity  engagemen t and service,  environmental  education,  and value -based  education.  \\nEnvironment  education  will include  areas  such as climate  change,  pollution,  waste  management,  \\nsanitation,  conservation  of biological  diversity,  management  of biological  resources  and biodiv ersity,  \\nforest  and wildlife  conservation,  and sustainable  development  and living.  Value -based  education  will \\ninclude  the development  of humanistic,  ethical,  Constitutional,  and universal  human  values  of truth \\n(satya ), righteous  conduct  (dharma ), peace  (shanti), love (prem ), nonviolence  (ahimsa ), scientific  \\ntemper,  citizenship  values,  and also life-skills;  lessons  in seva/service  and participation  in community  \\nservice  programmes  will be considered  an integral  part of a holistic  education.  As the world  is \\nbecoming  increasingly  interconnecte d, Global  Citizenship  Education  (GCED),  a response  to \\ncontemporary  global  challenges,  will be provided  to empower  learners  to become  aware  of and \\nunderstand  global  issues  and to become  active  promoters  of more  peaceful,  tolerant, inclusive,  secure,  \\nand sustainable  societies.  Finally,  as part of a holistic  education,  students  at all HEIs  will be provided  \\nwith opportunities  for internships  with local  industry,  businesses,  artists,  crafts  persons,  etc., as well \\nas research  internships  with faculty  and research ers at their own or other  HEIs/research  institutions,  \\nso that students  may actively  engage  with the practical  side of their learning  and, as a by-product,  \\nfurther  improve  their employability.  \\n11.9.  The structure  and lengths  of degree  programmes  shall  be adjusted  accordingly.  The \\nundergraduate  degree  will be of either  3 or 4-year duration,  with multiple  exit options  within  this \\nperiod,  with appropriate  certifications,  e.g., a certificate  after completing  1 year in a discipline  or field \\nincluding  vocational  and professional  areas , or a diploma  after 2 years  of study,  or a Bachelor  ’s \\ndegree  after a 3-year programme.  The 4-year multidisciplinary  Bachelor's  programme,  however,  shall  \\nbe the preferred  option  since  it allows  the oppor tunity  to experience  the full range of holistic  and \\nmultidisciplinary  education  in addition  to a focus  on the chosen  major  and minors  as per the choices  \\nof the student . An Academic  Bank  of Credit  (ABC)  shall  be established  which  would  digitally  store  \\nthe academic  credits  earned  from  various recognized  HEIs  so that the degrees  from  an HEI can be \\nawarded  taking  into account  credits  earned.

Undertaking  a Ph.D.  shall  requir e either  a \\nMaster ’s degree  or a 4-year Bachelor ’s degree  with Research.  The M.Phil.  programme  shall  be \\ndiscontinued.  \\n11.11.  Model  public  universities  for holistic  and multidisciplinary  education,  at par with IITs,  IIMs,  \\netc., called  MERUs  (Multidisciplinar y Education  and Research  Universities)  will be set up and will \\naim to attain  the highest  global  standards  in quality  education.  They  will also help set the highest  \\nstandards  for multidisciplinary  education  across  India.  \\n11.12.  HEIs  will focus  on research  and innovation  by setting  up start-up incubation  centres ; \\ntechnology  development  centres ; centres  in frontier  areas  of research ; greater  industry -academic  \\nlinkages ; and interdisciplinary  research  including  humanities  and social  scienc es research.  Given  the \\nscenario  of epidemics  and pandemics,  it is critical  that HEIs  take the lead to undertake  research  in \\nareas  of infectious  diseases,  epidemiology,  virology,  diagnostics,  instrumentation,  vaccinology  and \\nother  relevant  areas.  HEIs  will develop  specific  hand  holding  mechanisms  and competitions  for \\npromoting  innovation  among  student  communities.  The NRF  will function  to help enable  and support  \\nsuch a vibrant  research  and innovation  culture  across  HEIs,  research  labs, and other  research  \\norganizations . \\n12. Optimal  Learning  Environments  and Support  for Students  \\n12.1.  Effective  learning  requires  a comprehensive  approach  that involve s appropriate  curriculum , \\nengaging  pedagogy,  continuous  formative  assessment,  and adequate  student  support.  The curriculum  \\nmust  be intere sting  and relevant,  and updated  regularly  to align  with the latest  knowledge  \\nrequirements  and to meet  specified  learning  outcomes.  High -quality  pedagogy  is then necessary  to \\nsuccessfully  impart  the curricular  material  to students;  pedagogical  practices  determine  the learning  \\nexperiences  that are provided  to students , thus directly  influencing  learning  outcomes.  The \\nassessment  methods  must  be scientific,  designed  to continuously  improve  learning  and test the \\napplication  of knowledge.  Last but not least,  the development  of capacities  that promote  student  \\nwellness  such as fitness,  good  health,  psycho -social  well-being,  and sound  ethical  grounding  are also \\ncritical  for high-quality  learning.   \\nThus,  curriculum , pedagogy,  continuous  assessme nt, and student  support  are the cornerstones  for \\nquality  learning.  Along  with providing  suitable  resources  and infrastructure , such as quality  libraries,  \\nclassrooms,  labs, technology,  sports/recreation  areas,  student  discussion  spaces,  and dining  areas,  a \\nnumber  of initiatives  will be required  to ensure  that learning  environments  are engaging  and \\nsupportive,  and enable  all student s to succeed.  \\n12.2. First,  in order  to promote  creativity,  institutions  and faculty  will have the autonomy  to innovate  \\non matters  of curriculum,  pedagog y, and assessment  within  a broad  framework  of higher  education  \\nqualifications  that ensures  consistency  across  institutions  and programmes  and across  the ODL,  \\nonline,  and  traditional   ‘in-class’  modes.  Accordingly,  curriculum  and pedagogy  will be designed  by \\ninstitutions  and motivated  faculty  to ensure  a stimulating  and engaging  learning  experience  for all \\nstudents,  and continuous  formative  assessment  will be used to further  the goals  of each programme.  \\nAll assessment  systems  shall  also be decided  by the HEI, including  those  that lead to final \\ncertification.  The Choice  Based  Credit  System  (CBCS)  will be revise d for instilling  innovation  and \\nflexibility.  HEIs  shall  move  to a criterion -based  grading  system  that assesses  student  achievement  \\nbased  on the learning  goals  for each programme,  making  the system  fairer  and outcomes  more  \\ncomparable.  HEIs  shall  also move  away from  high-stake s examinations  towards  more  continuous  and \\ncomprehensive  evaluation .

Second , each institution  will integrate  its academic  plans  ranging  from  curricular  improvement  \\nto quality  of classroom  transaction  - into its larger  Institutional  Development  Plan (IDP).  Each  \\ninstitution  will be committed  to the holistic  development  of students  and create  strong  internal  \\nsystems  for supporting  diverse  student  cohorts  in academic  and social  domains  both inside  and \\noutside  formal  academic  interactio ns in the classroom.  For example,  all HEIs  will have  mechanisms  \\nand opportunities  for funding  of topic -centred  clubs  and activities  organized  by students  with the help \\nof faculty  and other  experts  as needed , such as clubs  and events  dedicated  to science,  mathematics,  \\npoetry,  language,  literature,  debate,  music,  sports , etc. Over  time,  such activities  could  be \\nincorporated  into the curriculum  once  appropria te faculty  expertise  and campus  student  demand  is \\ndeveloped.  Faculty  will have  the capacity  and trainin g to be able to approach  students  not just as \\nteachers,  but also as mentors  and guides.  \\n12.4. Third,  students  from  socio -economically  disadvantaged  backg rounds  require  encouragement  \\nand support  to make  a successful  transition  to higher  education . Universities  and colleges  will thus be \\nrequired  to set up high-quality  support  centres  and will be given  adequate  funds  and academic  \\nresources  to carry  this out effectively.  There  will also be professional  academic  and career \\ncounselling  available  to all students,  as well as counsellors  to ensure  physical , psychological  and \\nemotional  well-being.  \\n12.5. Fourth,  ODL  and online  education  provide  a natural  path to incre ase access  to quality  higher  \\neducation.  In order  to leverage  its potential  completely,  ODL  will be renewed  through  concerted,  \\nevidence -based  efforts  towards  expansion  while  ensuring  adherence  to clearly  articulated  standards  of \\nquality.  ODL  programmes  will aim to be equivalent  to the highest  quality  in-class  program mes \\navailable.  Norms,  standards,  and guidelines  for systemic  development,  regulation,  and accreditation  \\nof ODL  will be prepared,  and a framework  for quality  of ODL  that will be recommendatory  for all \\nHEIs  will be developed.  \\n12.6. Finally,  all programmes,  courses,  curricula,  and pedagogy  across  subjects,  including  those  in-\\nclass,  online,  and  in ODL  modes  as well as student  support  will aim to achieve  global  standards  of \\nquality.   \\nInternationali zation \\n12.7. The various  initiatives  mentioned  above  will also help in having  larger  numbers  of international  \\nstudents  studying  in India,  and provide  greater  mobility  to students  in India  who may wish  to visit,  \\nstudy  at, transfer  credits  to, or carry  out research at institutions  abroad,  and vice versa.  Courses  and \\nprogrammes  in subjects , such as Indology,  Indian  languages , AYUSH  systems  of medicine , yoga,  \\narts, music,  history,  culture,  and modern  India,  internationally  relevant  curricula  in the sciences,  \\nsocia l sciences,  and beyond,  meaningful  opportunities  for social  engagement,  quality  residential  \\nfacilities  and on-campus  support,  etc. will be fostered  to attain  this goal of global  quality  standards,  \\nattract  greater  numbers  of international  students,  and achieve the goal of  ‘internationalization  at \\nhome ’. \\n12.8. India  will be promoted  as a global  study  destination  providing  premium  education  at affordable  \\ncosts  thereby  helping  to restore  its role as a Vishwa  Guru.  An International  Students  Office  at each \\nHEI hosting  foreign  students  will be set up to coordinate  all matters  relating  to welcoming  and \\nsupporting  students  arriving  from  abroad.  Research/teaching  collaborations  and faculty/student  \\nexchanges  with high-quality  foreign  institutions  will be facilitated,  and relevant  mutually  beneficial  \\nMOUs  with foreign  coun tries will be signed.  High  performing  Indian  universities  will be encouraged  \\nto set up campuses  in other  countries,  and similarly,  select ed universities  e.g., those  from  among  the \\ntop 100 universities  in the world  will be facilitated  to operate  in India.  A legislative  framework  \\nfacilitating  such entry  will be put in place,  and such universities  will be given  special  dispensation  \\nregarding  regulatory,  governance,  and content  norms  on par with other  autono mous  institutions  of \\nIndia.  Furthermore,  research  collaboration  and student  exchanges  between  Indian  institutions  and \\nglobal  institutions  will be promoted  through  special  efforts.

Vibrant  campus  life is essential  for \\nhigh-quality  teaching -learning  proce sses. Towards  this end, students  will be given  plenty  of \\nopportunities  for participation  in sports,  culture/arts  clubs,  eco-clubs,  activity  clubs,  community  \\nservice  projects,  etc. In every  education  institution,  there  shall  be counselling  systems  for handl ing \\nstress  and emotional  adjustments.  Furthermore,  a systematized  arrangement  shall  be created  to \\nprovide  the requisite  support  to students  from  rural  backgrounds,  including  increasing  hostel  facilities  \\nas needed.  All HEIs  will ensure  quality  medical  facilities for all students  in their institutions.   \\nFinanci al support  for students  \\n12.10. Financial  assistance  to students  shall  be made  available  through  various  measures.  Efforts  will \\nbe made  to incentivi ze the merit  of students  belonging  to SC, ST, OBC,  and other  SEDGs.  The \\nNational  Scholarship  Portal  will be expanded  to support , foster , and track  the progress  of students  \\nreceiving  scholarships.  Private  HEIs  will be encouraged  to offer  larger  numbers  of free ships  and \\nscholarships  to their students.  \\n13. Motiv ated,  Energized , and Capable  Faculty  \\n13.1.  The most  important  factor  in the success  of higher  education  institutions  is the quality  and \\nengagement  of its faculty.  Acknowledging  the criticality  of faculty  in achieving  the goals  of higher  \\neducation,  various  initiatives  have  been  introduced  in the past several  years  to systematize   \\nrecruitment  and career  progression,  and to ensure  equitable  representation  from  various  groups  in the \\nhiring  of faculty.  Compensation  levels  of permanent  faculty  in public  instituti ons have  also been \\nincreased  substantially.  Various  initiatives  have  also been  taken  towards  providing  faculty  with \\nprofessional  development  opportunities.  However,  despite  these  various  improvements  in the status  \\nof the academic  profession,  faculty  motiva tion in terms  of teaching,  research,  and service  in HEIs \\nremains  far lower  than the desired  level.  The various  factors  that lie behind  low faculty  motivation  \\nlevels  must  be addressed  to ensure  that each faculty  member  is happy,  enthusiastic,  engaged,  and \\nmotivated  towards  advancing  her/his  students,  institution,  and profession.  To this end, the policy  \\nrecommends  the following  initiatives  to achieve  the best, motivated,  and capable  faculty  in HEIs.  \\n13.2.  As the most  basic  step, all HEIs  will be equipped  with the basic  infrastructure  and facilities , \\nincluding  clean  drinking  water,  clean  working  toilets,  blackboards,  offices,  teaching  supplies,  \\nlibraries,  labs, and pleasant  classroom  spaces  and campuses.  Every  classroom  shall  have  access  to the \\nlatest  education al technology  that enables  better  learning  experiences.     \\n13.3.  Teaching  duties  also will not be excessive,  and student -teacher  ratios  not too high,  so that the \\nactivity  of teaching  remains  pleasant  and there  is adequate  time for interaction  with students , \\nconducting  research,  and other  university  activities.  Faculty  will be appointed  to individual  \\ninstitutions  and generally  not be transferable  across  institutions  so that they may feel truly  invested  in, \\nconnected  to, and committed  to their institution  and community.  \\n13.4.  Faculty  will be given  the freedom  to design  their own curricular  and pedagogical  approaches  \\nwithin  the approved  framework,  including  textbook  and reading  material  selections,  assignments,  and \\nassessments.  Empowering  the faculty  to conduct  innovative  teaching,  research,  and service  as they \\nsee best will be a key motivator  and enabler  for them  to do truly  outstanding,  creative  work.  \\n13.5.  Excellence  will be further  incentivized  through  appropriate  rewards,  promotions,  recognitions,  \\nand movem ent into institutional  leadership.  Meanwhile,  faculty  not deliver ing on basic  norms  will be \\nheld account able. \\n13.6.  In keeping  with the vision  of autonomous  institutions  empowered  to drive  excellence,  HEIs  will \\nhave  clearly  defined,  independent,  and transp arent  processes  and criteria  for faculty  recruitment.  \\nWhereas  the current  recruitment  process  will be continued,  a  ‘tenure -track’  i.e., suitable  probatio n \\nperiod  shall  be put in place  to further  ensure  excellence.  There  shall  be a fast-track  promotion  system ', metadata={'source': '/Users/anupam/Documents/Debtanaya docs/National_Education_Policy_2020.pdf', 'page': 40}),\n",

The presence  of outstanding  and enthusiastic  institutional  leaders  that cultivate  excellence  and \\ninnovation  is the need  of the hour.  Outstanding  and effective  institutional  leadership  is extremely  \\nimportant  for the success  of an instituti on and of its faculty.  Excellent  faculty  with high academic  and \\nservice  credentials  as well as demonstrated  leadership  and management  skills  will be identified  early  \\nand trained  through  a ladder  of leadership  positions.  Leade rship  positions  shall  not remai n vacant,  but \\nrather  an overlapping  time period  during  transitions  in leadership  shall  be the norm  to ensure  the \\nsmooth  running  of institutions.  Institutional  leaders  will aim to create  a culture  of excellence  that will \\nmotiv ate and incentivize  outstanding  and innovative  teaching,  research,  institutional  service,  and \\ncommunity  outreach  from  faculty  members  and all HEI leaders.   \\n14. Equity  and Inclusion  in Higher  Education  \\n14.1.  Entry  into quality  higher  education  can open  a vast array  of possibilities  that can lift both \\nindividuals  as well as communities  out of the cycles  of disadvantage.   For this reason,  making  quality  \\nhigher  education  opportunities  available  to all individuals  must  be among  the highest  priorities.  This \\nPolic y envisions  ensuring  equitable  access  to quality  education  to all students,  with a special  \\nemphasis  on SEDGs.   \\n14.2.  The dynamics  and also many  of the reasons   for exclusion  of SEDGs  from  the education  system  \\nare common  across  school  and higher  education  sectors.  Therefore,  the approach  to equity  and \\ninclusion  must  be common  across  school  and higher  education . Furthermore,  there  must  be continuity  \\nacross  the stages  to ensure  sustainable  reform.  Thus,  the policy  initiatives  required  to meet  the goals \\nof equity and inclusion  in higher  education  must  be read in conjunction  with those  for school  \\neducation.  \\n14.3.  There  are certain  facets  of exclusion,  that are particular  to or substantially  more  intense  in \\nhigher  education.

Teacher  Education  \\n15.1.  Teacher  education  is vital in creating  a pool of schoolteachers  that will shape  the next \\ngeneration.  Teacher  preparation  is an activity  that requires  multidisciplinary  perspectives  and \\nknowledge,  formation  of dispositions  and values, and development  of practice  under  the best \\nmentors.  Teachers  must  be grounded  in Indian  values,  languages,  knowledge,  ethos,  and traditions  \\nincluding  tribal  traditions , while  also being  well-versed  in the latest  advances  in education  and \\npedagogy.  \\n15.2. According  to the Justice  J. S. Verma  Commission  (2012)  constituted  by the Supreme  Court,  a \\nmajority  of stand -alone  TEIs  - over 10,000  in number  are not even  attempting  serious  teacher  \\neducation  but are essentially  selling  degrees  for a price.  Regulatory  efforts  so far have  neither  been \\nable to curb the malpractices  in the system,  nor enforce  basic  standards  for quality,  and in fact have \\nhad the negative  effect  of curbing  the growth  of excellence  and innovation  in the sector.  The sector  \\nand its regulatory  system  are, therefore , in urgent  need  of revitalization  through  radical  action,  in \\norder  to raise  standards  and restore  integrity,  credibility,  efficacy,  and high quality  to the teacher  \\neducation  system.  \\n15.3.  In order  to improve  and reach  the levels  of integrity  and credibility  required  to restore  the \\nprestige  of the teaching  profession,  the Regulatory  System  shall be empowered  to take stringent  \\naction  against  substandard  and dysfunctional  teacher  education  institutions  (TEIs) that do not meet  \\nbasic  educa tional  criteria , after giving  one year for remedy  of the breaches . By 2030 , only \\neducationally  sound,  multidisci plinary,  and integrated  teacher  education  programmes  shall  be in \\nforce.  \\n15.4.  As teacher  education  requires  multidisciplinary  inputs,  and educat ion in high-quality  content  as \\nwell as pedagogy , all teacher  education  programmes  must  be conducted  within  compo site \\nmultidisciplinary  institutions.  To this end, all multidisciplinary  universities  and colleges  - will aim to \\nestablish,  education  departments  which,  besides  carrying  out cutting -edge  research  in various  aspects  \\nof education,  will also run B.Ed.   program mes, in collaboration  with other  departments  such as \\npsychology,  philosophy,  sociology,  neuroscience,  Indian  languages,  arts, music,  history,  literature,  \\nphysical  education,  science  and mathematics.  Moreover,  all stand -alone  TEIs  will be required  to \\nconver t to multidisciplinary  institutions  by 2030,  since  they will have  to offer  the 4-year integrated  \\nteacher  preparation  programme.   \\n15.5.  The 4-year integrated  B.Ed.  offered  by such multidisciplinary  HEIs  will, by 2030,  become  the \\nminimal  degree  qualification  for school  teachers.  The 4-year integrated  B.Ed.  will be a dual-major  \\nholistic  Bachelor ’s degree,  in Education  as well as a specialized  subject  such as a language,  history,  \\nmusic,  mathematics,  computer  science,  chemistry,  economics,  art, physical  education,  etc. Beyond  ', metadata={'source': '/Users/anupam/Documents/Debtanaya docs/National_Education_Policy_2020.pdf', 'page': 42}),\n",

The HEI offering  the 4-year \\nintegrated  B.Ed.  may also run a 2-year B.Ed ., for students  who have  already  receive d a Bach elor’s \\ndegree  in a specialized  subject . A 1-year B.Ed.  may also be offered  for candidates  who have  received  \\na 4-year undergraduate  degree  in a specialized  subject.  Scholarships  for meritorious  students  will be \\nestablished  for the purpose  of attract ing outstanding  candidates  to the 4-year,  2-year,  and 1-year \\nB.Ed.  programmes.   \\n15.6.  HEIs  offering  teacher  education  programmes  will ensure  the availability  of a range  of experts  in \\neducation  and related  disciplines  as well as specialized  subjects.  Each  higher  education  institution  \\nwill have  a network  of government  and private  schools  to work  closely  with,  where  potential  teachers  \\nwill student -teach  along  with participating  in other  activities  such as community  service,  adult  and \\nvocational  education,  etc. \\n15.7.  In order  to maintain  uniform  standards  for teacher  education,  the admission  to pre-service  \\nteacher  preparation  programmes  shall  be through  suitable  subject  and aptitude  tests conducted  by the \\nNational  Testing  Agency,  and shall  be standardized  keepin g in view the linguistic  and cultural  \\ndiversity  of the country.   \\n15.8.  The faculty  profile  in Departments  of Education  will necessarily  aim to be diverse  and but \\nteaching/field/research  experience  will be highly  valued.  Faculty  with training  in areas  of social \\nsciences  that are directly  relevant  to school  education  e.g., psychology,  child  development,  \\nlinguistics,  sociology,  philosophy,  economics,  and political  science  as well as from  science  education,  \\nmathematics  education,  social  science  education,  and language  education  programmes  will be \\nattracted  and retained  in teacher  education  institutions,  to strengthen  multidisciplinary  education  of \\nteachers  and provide  rigour  in conceptual  development.  \\n15.9.  All fresh  Ph.D.  entrants,  irrespective  of discipline,  will be required  to take credit -based  courses  \\nin teaching/education/pedagogy/writing  related  to their chosen  Ph.D  subject  during  their doctoral  \\ntraining  period.  Exposure  to pedagogical  practices,  designing  curriculum,  credible  evaluation  \\nsystems,  communicat ion, and so on will be ensured  since  many  research  scholars  will go on to \\nbecome  faculty  or public  representatives/communicators  of their chosen  disciplines.  Ph.D  students  \\nwill also have  a minimum  number  of hours  of actual  teaching  experience  gathered  through teaching \\nassistantships  and other  means.  Ph.D.  programmes  at universities  around  the country  will be re-\\noriented  for this purpose.   \\n15.10.  In-service  continuous  professional  development  for college  and university  teachers  will \\ncontinue  through  the existing  institutional  arrangements  and ongoing  initiatives;  these  will be \\nstrengthened  and substantially  expanded  to meet  the needs  of enriched  teaching -learning  processes  \\nfor quality  education.  The use of technology  platforms  such as SWAYAM/ DIKSHA  for online  \\ntrainin g of teachers  will be encouraged,  so that standardized  training  programmes  can be \\nadministered  to large  numbers  of teachers  within  a short  span of time.   \\n15.11.  A National  Mission  for Mentoring  shall  be established,  with a large  pool of outstanding  \\nsenior/ retired  faculty  – including  those  with the ability  to teach  in Indian  languages  – who would  be \\nwilling  to provide  short  and long-term mentoring/professional  support  to university/college  teachers.  \\n16. Reimagining  Vocational  Educati on \\n16.1.  The 12th Five-Year Plan (2012–2017)  estimated  that only a very small  percentage  of the Indian  \\nworkforce  in the age group  of 19–24 (less than 5%) received  formal  vocational  education  Whereas  in \\ncountries  such as the USA  the number  is 52%,  in Germany  75%,  and South  Korea  it is as high as \\n96%.  These  numbers  only underline  the urgency  of the need  to hasten  the spread  of vocational  \\neducation  in India.

       " Document(page_content=' \\n \\nNational  Education  Policy  2020  \\n44 \\n 16.2.   One of the primary  reasons  for the small  numbers  of students  receiving  vocational  education  is \\nthe fact that vocational  education  has in the past focused  largely  on Grades  11–12 and  on dropouts  in \\nGrade  8 and upwards.  Moreover,  students  passing  out from  Grades  11–12 with vocational  subjects  \\noften  did not have  well-defined  pathways  to continue  with their chosen  vocations  in higher  education.  \\nThe admission  criteria  for general  higher  education  were  also not designed  to provide  openings  to \\nstudents  who had vocational  education  qualifications,  leaving  them  at a disadvantage  relative  to their \\ncompatriots  from   ‘mainstream ’ or  ‘academic’ education . This led to a complete  lack of vertical  \\nmobility  for students  from  the vocational  education  stream,  an issue  that has only been  addressed  \\nrecently  through  the announcement  of the National  Skills  Qualifications  Framework  (NSQF)  in 2013.  \\n16.3. Vocational  education  is perceived  to be inferior  to mainstream  education  and meant  largely  for \\nstudents  who are unable  to cope  with the latter.  This is a percept ion that affects  the choices  students  \\nmake.  It is a serious  concern  that can only be dealt  with by a complete  re-imagination  of how \\nvocational  education  is offered  to students  in the future.   \\n16.4.  This policy  aims  to overcome  the social  status  hierarchy  associated  with vocational  education    \\nand requires  integration  of vocational  education  programmes  into mainstream  education  in all \\neducation  institutions  in a phased  manner . Beginning  with vocational  exposure  at early  ages in \\nmiddle  and secondary  school , quality  vocational  education  will be integrated  smoothly  into higher  \\neducation . It will ensure that every  child  learns  at least one vocation  and is exposed  to several  more . \\nThis would  lead to emphasi zing the dignity  of labour  and importance  of various  vocat ions involving  \\n/Indian  arts and artisanship.  \\n16.5.  By 2025,  at least 50% of learners  throug h the school  and higher  education  system  shall  have \\nexposure  to vocational  education , for which  a clear  action  plan with targets  and timelines  will be \\ndeveloped.  This is in alignment  with Sustainable  Development  Goal  4.4 and will help to realize  the \\nfull potential  of India  ’s demographic  dividend.  The number  of students  in vocational  education  will \\nbe considered  while  arriving  at the GER  targets.  The development  of vocational  capacities  will go \\nhand -in-hand  with the development  of  ‘academic ’ or other  capacit ies. Vocational  education  will be \\nintegrated  in the educational  offerings  of all secondary  schools  in a phased  manner  over the next \\ndecade.  Towards  this, secondary  schools  will also collaborate  with ITIs,  polytechnics,  local  industry,  \\netc. Skill  labs will also be set up and created  in the schools  in a hub and spoke  model  which  will \\nallow  other  schools  to use the facility.  Higher  education  institutions  will offer  vocational  education  \\neither  on their own or in partnership  with industry  and NGOs.  The B.Voc.  degrees  introduced  in 2013  \\nwill continue  to exist,  but vocational  courses  will also be available  to students  enrolled  in all other  \\nBachelor ’s degree  programmes,  including  the 4-year multidisciplinary  Bachelor  ’s programmes.  HEIs  \\nwill also be allowed  to conduc t short-term certificate  courses  in various  skills  including  soft skills.  \\n‘Lok Vidya’, i.e., important  vocational  knowledge  developed  in India,  will be made  accessible  to \\nstudents  through  integration  into vocational  education  courses.  The possibility  of offerin g vocational  \\ncourses  through  ODL  mode  will also be explored.  \\n16.6.  Vocational  education  will be integrated  into all school  and higher  education  institutions  in a \\nphased  manner  over the next decade.  Focus  areas  for vocational  education  will be chosen  based on \\nskills  gap analysis  and mapping  of local  opportunities . MHRD  will constitute  a National  Committee  \\nfor the Integration  of Vocational  Education  (NCIVE),  consisting  of experts  in vocational  education  \\nand representatives  from  across  Ministries,  in collabora tion with industry,  to oversee  this effort . \\n16.7.  Individual  institutions  that are early  adopters  must  innovate  to find models  and practices  that \\nwork  and then share  these  with other  institutions  through  mechanisms  set up by NCIVE,  so as to help \\nexten d the reach  of vocational  education.  Different  models  of vocational  education,  and \\napprenticeships,  will also be experimented  by higher  education  institutions.  Incubation  centres  will be \\nset up in higher  education  institutions  in partnership  with industrie s. \\n16.8. The National  Skills  Qualifications  Framework  will be detailed  further  for each discipline  \\nvocation  and profession.  Further,  Indian  standards  will be aligned  with the International  Standard  \\nClassification  of Occupations  maintained  by the Internatio nal Labour  Organization .

The credit -based Framework  will also facilitate  mobility  across  ‘general’  and vocational  \\neducation.  \\n17. Catalysing  Quality  Academic  Research  in All Fields  through  a new National  \\nResearch  Foundation  \\n17.1. Knowledge  creation  and research  are critical  in growing  and sustaining  a large  and vibrant  \\neconomy,  uplifting  society,  and continuously  inspiring  a nation  to achieve  even greater  heights.  \\nIndeed,  some  of the most  prosperous  civilizations  (such  as India , Mesopotamia,  Egypt,  and Greece)  \\nto the modern  era (such  as the United  States,  Germany,  Israel,  South  Korea,  and Japan),  were/are  \\nstrong  knowledge  societies  that attained  intellectual  and material  wealth  in large  part through  \\ncelebrated  and fundamental  contributions  to new knowledge  in the realm  of science  as well as art, \\nlanguage,  and culture  that enhanced  and uplifted  not only their own civilizations  but  others   around  \\nthe globe.  \\n17.2. A robust  ecosystem  of research  is perhaps  more  important  than ever with the rapid  changes  \\noccurring  in the world  today,  e.g., in the realm  of climate  change,  population  dynamics  and \\nmanagement,  biotechnology,  an expanding  digital  marketplace,  and the rise of machine  learning  and \\nartificial  intelligence.  If India  is to become a leader  in these  disparate  areas,  and truly  achieve  the \\npotent ial of its vast talent  pool to again  become  a leading  knowledge  society  in the coming  years  and \\ndecades,  the nation  will require  a significant  expansion  of its research  capabilities  and output across  \\ndisciplines.  Today,  the criticality  of research  is more  than ever before , for the economic,  intellectual,  \\nsocietal,  environmental,  and technological  health  and progress  of a nation.  \\n17.3. Despite  this critical  importance  of research,  the research  and innovation  investment  in India  is, \\nat the current  time,  only 0.69%  of GDP  as compared  to 2.8%  in the United  States  of America,  4.3%  \\nin Israel  and 4.2%  in South  Korea .  \\n17.4. The societal  challenges  that India  needs  to address  today,  such as access  for all its citizens  to \\nclean  drinking  water  and sanitation,  quality  education  and healthcare,  improved  transportation,  air \\nquality,  energy,  and infrastructure,  will require  the implementation  of approaches  and solutions  that \\nare not only informed  by top-notch  science  and technology  but are also rooted  in a deep \\nunderstandi ng of the social  sciences  and humanities  and the various  socio -cultural  and environmental  \\ndimensions  of the nation.  Facing  and addressing  these  challenges  will require high-quality  \\ninterdisciplinary  research  across  fields  that must  be done  in India  and cannot simply  be imported;  the \\nability  to conduct  one ’s own research  also enables  a country  to much  more  easily  import  and adapt  \\nrelevant  research  from  abroad.   \\n17.5. Furthermore,  in addition  to their value  in solutions  to societal  problems,  any country's  identity,  \\nupliftment,  spiritual/intellectual  satisfaction  and creativity  is also attained  in a major  way through  its \\nhistory,  art, language,  and culture.  Research  in the arts and humanities,  along  with innovations  in the \\nsciences  and social  sciences,  are, therefore , extremely  important  for the progress  and enlightened  \\nnature  of a nation.  \\n17.6. Research  and innovation  at education  institutions  in India,  particularly  those that are engaged  in \\nhigher  education,  is critical.  Evidence  from  the world ’s best universi ties throughout  history  shows  \\nthat the best teaching  and learning  processes  at the higher  education  level  occur  in environments  \\nwhere  there  is also a strong  culture  of research  and knowledge  creation;  conversely,  much  of the very \\nbest research  in the world  has occurred  in multidisciplinary  university  settings.  \\n17.7. India  has a long historical  tradition  of research  and knowledge  creation,  in disciplines  ranging  \\nfrom  science  and mathematics  to art and literature  to phonetics  and languages  to medicine  and \\nagriculture . This needs  to be further  strengthened  to make  India  lead research  and innovation  in the \", metadata={'source': '/Users/anupam/Documents/Debtanaya docs/National_Education_Policy_2020.pdf', 'page': 45}),\n",

Thus,  this Policy  envisions  a comprehen sive approach  to transforming  the quality  and quantity  \\nof research  in India.  This includes  definitive  shifts  in school  education  to a more  play and discovery - \\nbased  style  of learning  with emphasis  on the scientific  method  and critical  thinking . This includ es \\ncareer  counselling  in schools  towards  identifying  student  interests  and talents,  promoting  research  in \\nuniversities,  the multidisciplinary  nature  of all HEIs  and the emphasis  on holistic  education,  the \\ninclusion  of research  and internships  in the underg raduate  curriculum,  faculty  career  management  \\nsystems  that give due weightage  to research,  and the governance  and regulatory  changes  that \\nencourage  an environment  of  research  and innovation . All of these  aspects  are extremely  critical  for \\ndeveloping  a research  mindset  in the country.  \\n17.9. To build  on these  various  elements  in a synergistic  manner,  and to thereby  truly  grow  and \\ncatalyze  quality  research  in the nation,  this policy  envisions  the establishment  of a National  Resear ch \\nFoundation  (NRF).  The overarching  goal of the NRF  will be to enable  a culture  of research  to \\npermeate  through  our universities.  In particular,  the NRF  will provide  a reliable  base of merit -based  \\nbut equitable  peer-reviewed  research  funding,  helping  to develop  a culture  of research  in the country  \\nthrough  suitable  incentives  for and recognition  of outstanding  research,  and by undertaking  major  \\ninitiatives  to seed and grow  research  at State  Universities  and other  public  institutions  where  research  \\ncapabilit y is currently  limited.  The NRF will competitively  fund research  in all disciplines.  \\nSuccessful  research  will be recognized , and where  relevant,  implemented  through  close  linkages  with \\ngovernmental  agencies  as well as with industry  and private/philanthropi c organizations . \\n17.10. Institutions  that currently  fund research  at some  level,  such as the Department  of Science  and \\nTechnology  (DST ), Department  of Atomic  Energy  (DAE ), Department  of Bio-Technology  (DBT ), \\nIndian  Council  of Agriculture  Research  (ICAR ), Indian  Council  of Medical  Rese arch (ICMR ), Indian  \\nCouncil  of Historical  Research  (ICHR ), and University  Grants  Commission  (UGC ), as well as \\nvarious  private  and philanthropic  organizations , will continue  to independently  fund research  \\naccording  to their priorities  and needs.   However,  NRF will carefully  coordinate  with other  funding  \\nagencies  and will work  with science,  engineering,  and other  academies  to ensure  synergy  of purpose  \\nand avoid  duplication  of efforts.   The NRF  will be governed,  independently  of the government,  by a \\nrotating  Board of Governors  consisting  of the very best researchers  and innovators  across  fields.  \\n17.11. The primary  activities  of the NRF  will be to: \\n \\n(a) fund competitiv e, peer-reviewed  grant  proposals  of all types  and across  all disciplines;  \\n(b) seed,  grow,  and facilitat e research  at academic  institutions,  particularly  at universities  and \\ncolleges  where  research  is currently  in a nascent  stage,  through  mentoring  of such \\ninstitutions ;  \\n(c) act as a liaison  between  researchers  and relevant  branches  of government  as well as industry, \\nso that research  scholars  are constantly  made  aware  of the most  urgent  national  research  \\nissues,  and so that policymakers  are constantly  made  aware  of the latest  research  \\nbreakthroughs;  so as to allow  breakthroughs  to be optimally  brought  into policy  and/or  \\nimplementation;  and \\n(d) recognise  outstanding  research  and progress   \\n \\n18. Transforming  the Regulatory  System  of Higher  Education  \\n18.1. Regulation  of higher  education  has been  too heavy -handed  for decades;  too much  has been \\nattempted  to be regulated  with too little effect.  The mechanistic  and disempowering  nature  of the \\nregulatory  system  has been  rife with very basic  problems,  such as heav y concentrations  of power  \\nwithin  a few bodies,  conflicts  of interest  among  these  bodies,  and a resulting  lack of accountability.  \\nThe regulatory  system  is in need  of a complete  overhaul  in order  to re-energize  the higher  education  \\nsector  and enable  it to thrive.

       " Document(page_content=' \\n \\nNational  Education  Policy  2020  \\n47 \\n 18.2. To address  the above -mentioned  issues,  the regulatory  system  of higher  education  will ensure    \\nthat the distinct  functions  of regulation,  accreditation,  funding,  and academic  standard  setting  will be \\nperformed  by distinct,  independent,  and empowered  bodies.  This is considered  essential  to create  \\nchecks -and-balances  in the system,  minimize  conflicts  of interes t, and eliminate  concentrations  of \\npower.  To ensure  that the four institutional  structures  carrying  out these  four essential  functions  work  \\nindependently  yet at the same  time and work  in synergy  towards  common  goals .  These four \\nstructures  will be set up as four independent  verticals  within  one umbrella  institution,  the Higher  \\nEducation  Commissi on of India  (HECI).   \\n18.3. The first vertical  of HECI  will be the National  Higher  Education  Regulatory  Council  (NHERC ). \\nIt will function  as the common,  single  point  regulator  for the higher  education  sector  including  \\nteacher  education  and excluding  medical  and legal  education , thus eliminating  the duplication  and \\ndisjunction  of regulatory  efforts  by the multiple  regulatory  agencies  that exist  at the current  time.  It \\nwill require  a relook  and repealing  of existing  Acts and restructuring  of various  existing  regulatory  \\nbodies  to enable  this single  point  regulation.  NHERC  will be set up to regulate  in a ‘light but tight’ \\nand facilitative  manner,  meaning  that a few importan t matters   particularly  financial  probity,  good  \\ngovernance,  and the full online  and offline  public  self-disclosure  of all finances,  audits,  procedures,  \\ninfrastructure,  faculty/staff,  courses,  and educational  outcomes   will be very effectively  regulated.  \\nThis information  will have  to be made  available  and kept updated  and accurate  by all higher  \\neducation  institutions  on a public  website  maintained  by NHERC  and on the institutions ’ websites . \\nAny complaints  or grievances  from  stakeholders  and others  arising  out of the information  placed  in \\npublic  domain  shall  be adjudicated  by NHERC.  Feedback  from  randomly  selected  students  including  \\ndifferently -abled  students  at each HEI will be solicited  online  to ensure  valuable  input  at regular  \\nintervals.  \\n18.4. The primary  mechanism  to enable  such regulation  will be accreditation.  The second  vertical  of \\nHECI  will, therefore,  be a  ‘meta -accrediting  body ’, called  the National  Accreditation  Council  (NAC).  \\nAccreditation  of institutions  will be based  primarily  on basic  norms,  public self-disclosure,  good  \\ngovernance,  and outcomes,  and it will be carried  out by an independent  ecosystem  of accrediting  \\ninstitutions  supervised  and overseen  by NAC.  The task to function as a recogni zed accreditor  shall  be \\nawarded  to an appropriate  number  of institutions  by NAC.  In the short  term,  a robust  system  of \\ngraded  accreditation  shall  be established,  which  will specify  phased  benchmarks  for all HEIs  to \\nachieve  set levels  of quality,  self-governance,  and autonomy.  In turn, all HEIs  will aim, through  their \\nInstitutional  Development  Plans  (IDPs),  to attain  the highest  level  of accreditation  over the next 15 \\nyears,  and thereby  eventually  aim to function  as self-governing  degree -granting  institutions/clusters.  \\nIn the long run, accreditation  will become  a binary  process,  as per the extant  global  practice.   \\n18.5. The third  vertical  of HECI  will be the Higher  Education  Grants  Council  (HEGC),  which  will \\ncarry  out funding  and financing  of higher  education  based  on transparent  criteria,  including  the IDPs  \\nprepa red by the institutions  and the progress  made  on their implementation.  HEGC  will be entrusted  \\nwith the disbursement  of scholarships  and developmental  funds  for launching  new focus  areas and \\nexpanding  quality  programme  offerings  at HEIs  across  disciplines  and fields.  \\n18.6. The fourth  vertical  of HECI  will be the General  Education  Council  (GEC),  which  will frame  \\nexpected  learning  outcomes  for higher  education  programmes,  also referred  to as ‘graduate  \\nattributes ’. A National  Higher  Education  Qualification  Fram ework  (NHEQF)  will be formulated  by \\nthe GEC  and it shall  be in sync with the National  Skills  Qualifications  Framework  (NSQF)  to ease \\nthe integration  of vocational  education  into highe r education.  Higher  education  qualifications  leading  \\nto a degree/diploma/ certificate  shall  be described  by the NHEQF  in terms  of such learning  outcomes.  \\nIn addition,  the GEC  shall  set up facilitative  norms  for issues,  such as credit  transfer,  equivalence,  \\netc., through  the NHEQF.  The GEC  will be mandated  to identify  specific  skills that students  must  \\nacquire  during  their academic  programmes,  with the aim of preparing  well-rounded  learners  with 21st \\ncentury  skills.    \\n18.7. The professional  councils,  such as the Indian  Council  for Agricultural  Research  (ICAR ), \\nVeterinary  Council  of India  (VCI), National  Council  for Teacher  Education  (NCTE ), Council  of \\nArchitecture  (CoA),  National  Council  for Vocational  Education  and Training  (NCVET)  etc., will act ', metadata={'source': '/Users/anupam/Documents/Debtanaya docs/National_Education_Policy_2020.pdf', 'page': 47}),\n",

They  will play a key role in the higher education  \\nsystem  and will be invited  to be members  of the GEC.  These  bodies,  after restructuring  as PSSBs,  \\nwill continue  to draw  the curricula,  lay down  academic  standards  and coordinate  between  teaching,  \\nresearch  and extension  of their domain/discipli ne, as members  of the GEC.   As members  of the GEC,  \\nthey would  help in specifying  the curriculum  framework,  within which  HEIs  may prepare  their own \\ncurricula.  Thus, PSSBs  would  also set the standards  or expectations  in particular  fields  of learning  \\nand practice while  having  no regulatory  role. All HEIs  will decide  how their educational  programmes  \\nrespond  to these  standards,  among  other  considerations,  and would  also be able to reach  out for \\nsupport  from  these  standard -setting  bodies  or PSSBs , if needed.  \\n18.8. Such  a system  architecture  will ensure  the principle  of functional  separation  by eliminating  \\nconflicts  of interests  between  different  roles . It will also aim to empower  HEIs,  while  ensuring  that \\nthe few key essential  matters  are given  due attention.  Resp onsibility  and accountability  shall  devolve  \\nto the HEIs  concomitantly.  No distinction  in such expectations  shall  be made  between  public  and \\nprivate  HEIs.  \\n18.9. Such  a transformation  will require  existing  structures  and institutions  to reinvent  themselves  \\nand undergo  an evolution  of sorts.  The separation  of functions  would  mean  that each vertical  within  \\nHECI  would  take on a new,  single  role which  is relevant,  meaningful,  and important  in the new \\nregulatory  scheme.  \\n18.10. The functioning  of all the independen t verticals  for Regulation  (NHERC),  Accreditation  \\n(NAC),  Funding  (HEGC),  and Academic  Standard  Setting  (GEC)  and the overarching  autonomous  \\numbrella  body  (HECI)  itself will be based  on transparent  public  disclosure,  and use technology  \\nextensively  to reduce  human  interface  to ensure  efficiency  and transparency  in their work . The \\nunderlying  principle  will be that of a faceless  and transparent  regulatory  intervention  using  \\ntechnology . Strict  compliance  measures  with stringent  action , including  penalties  for false disclosure  \\nof mandated  information,  will be ensured  so that Highe r Education  Institutions  are conforming  to the \\nbasic  minimum  norms  and standards.  HECI  itself  will be resolving  disputes  among  the four verticals.  \\nEach  vertical  in HECI  will be an indepen dent body  consisting  of persons  having  high expertise  in the \\nrelevant  areas  along  with integrity,  commitment,  and a demonstrated  track  record  of public  service.  \\nHECI  itself  will be a small,  independent  body  of eminent  public -spirited  experts  in higher  educ ation,  \\nwhich  will oversee  and monitor  the integrity  and effective  functioning  of HECI.  Suitable  mechanisms  \\nwill be created  within  HECI  to carry  out its functions,  including  adjudication .  \\n18.11. Setting  up new quality  HEIs  will also be made  far easier  by the regulatory  regime,  while  \\nensuring  with great  effectiveness  that these are set up with the spirit  of public  service  and with due \\nfinancial  backing  for long-term stability.  HEIs  performing  exceptionally  well will be helped  by \\nCentral  and State  governments  to expand  their institutions,  and thereby  attain  larger  numbers  of \\nstudents  and faculty  as well as disciplines  and programmes . Public  Philanthropic  Partnership  models  \\nfor HEIs  may also be piloted  with the aim to further  expand  access  to high-quality  highe r education.   \\nCurbing  Commercialization  of Education  \\n \\n18.12. Multiple  mechanisms  with checks  and balances  will combat  and stop the commerciali zation  of \\nhigher  education.  This will be a key priority  of the regulatory  system.  All education  institutions  will \\nbe held to similar  standards  of audit  and disclosure  as a ‘not for profit’  entity . Surpluses , if any, will \\nbe reinvested  in the educational  sector . There  will be transparent  public  disclosure  of all these \\nfinancial  matters  with recourse  to grievance -handli ng mechanisms  to the general  public.  The \\naccreditation  system  developed  by NAC  will provide  a complementary  check  on this system,  and \\nNHERC  will consider  this as one of the key dimensions  of its regulatory  objective.  \\n18.13. All HEIs  - public  and private  - shall  be treated  on par within  this regulatory  regime.  The \\nregulatory  regime  shall  encourage  private  philanthropic  efforts  in education.  There  will be common  \\nnational  guidelines  for all legislative  Acts that will form  private  HEIs.

These  common  guidelines  will cover  Good  Governance,  Financial  Stability  \\n& Security,  Educational  Outcomes,  and Transparency  of Disclosur es. \\n18.14. Private  HEIs  having  a philanthropic  and public -spirited intent  will be encouraged  through  a \\nprogressive  regime  of fees determination.  Transparent  mechanisms  for fixing  of fees with an upper  \\nlimit,  for different  types  of institutions  depending  on their accreditation,  will be developed  so that \\nindividual  institutions  are not adversely  affected.  This will empower  private  HEIs  to set fees for their \\nprogrammes  independently,  though  within  the laid-out norms  and the broad  applicable  regulatory  \\nmechanis m. Private  HEIs  will be encouraged  to offer  freeships  and scholarships  in significant  \\nnumbers  to their students.  All fees and charges  set by private  HEIs  will be transparently  and fully  \\ndisclosed,  and there  shall be no arbitrary  increases  in these  fees/cha rges during  the period  of \\nenrolment  of any student.  This fee determining  mechanism  will ensure  reasonable  recovery  of cost \\nwhile  ensuring  that HEIs  discharge  their social  obligations.  \\n19. Effective  Governance  and Leadership  for Higher  Education  Institution s \\n19.1. It is effective  governance  and leadership  that enables  the creation  of a culture  of excellence  and \\ninnovation  in higher  education  institutions.  The common  feature  of all world -class  institutions  \\nglobally  including  India  has indeed  been  the existenc e of strong  self-governance  and outstanding  \\nmerit -based  appointments  of institutional  leaders . \\n19.2. Through  a suitable  system  of graded  accreditation  and graded  autonomy,  and in a phased  \\nmanner  over a period  of 15 years , all HEIs  in India  will aim to become independent  self-governing  \\ninstitutions  pursuing  innovation  and excellence.  Measures  will be taken  at all HEIs  to ensure  \\nleadership  of the highest  quality  and promote  an institutional  culture  of excellence.  Upon  receiving  \\nthe appropriate  graded  accredit ations that deem  the institution  ready  for such a move , a Board  of \\nGovernors  (BoG)  shall  be established  consisting  of a group  of highly  qualified,  competent,  and \\ndedicated  individuals  having  proven  capabilities  and a strong  sense  of commitment  to the institution. \\nThe BoG  of an institution  will be empowered  to govern  the institution  free of any external  \\ninterference,  make  all appointments  including  that of head  of the institution,  and take all decisions  \\nregarding  governance.  There  shall  be overarching  legisl ation that will supersede  any contravening  \\nprovisions  of other  earlier  legislation  and would  provide  for constitution,  appointment,  modalities  of \\nfunctioning,  rules  and regulations,  and the roles  and responsibilities  of the BoG.  New  members  of the \\nBoard  shall be identified  by an expert  committee  appointed  by the Board;  and the selection  of new \\nmem bers shall  be carried  out by the BoG  itself.  Equity  considerations  will also be taken  care of while  \\nselecting  the members.  It is envisaged  that all HEIs  will be incentivized , supported,  and mentored  \\nduring  this process,  and shall  aim to become  autonomous  and have  such an empowered  BoG  by 2035.  \\n19.3.  The BoG  shall  be responsible  and accountable  to the stakeholders  through  transparent  self-\\ndisclosures  of all relevant  records.  It will be responsible  for meeting  all regulatory  guidelines  \\nmandated  by HECI  through  the National  Higher  Education  Regulatory  Council  (NHERC).  \\n19.4. All leadership  positions  and Head s of institutions  will be offered  to persons  with high academic  \\nqualifications  and demonstrated  administrative  and leadership  capabilities  along  with abilities  to \\nmanage  complex  situations.  Leaders  of an HEI will demonstrate  strong  alignment  to Constitutional  \\nvalues  and the overall vision  of the institution,  along  with attributes  such as a strong  social  \\ncommitment,  belief  in teamwork,  pluralism,  ability  to work  with diverse  people,  and a positive  \\noutlook.  The selection  shall be carried  out by the BoG  through  a rigorous,  impartial , merit -based,  and \\ncompetency -based  proce ss led by an Eminent  Expert  Committee  (EEC)  constituted  by the BoG.  \\nWhile  stability  of tenure  is important  to ensure  the development  of a suitable  culture,  at the same  time \\nleadership  succession  will be planned  with care to ensure  that good  practices  that define  an \\ninstitution ’s processes  do not end due to a change  in leadership;  leadership  changes  will come  with \\nsufficient  overlaps,  and not remain  vacant,  in order  to ensure  smooth  transitions.  Outstanding  leaders  \\nwill be identified  and developed  early,  working their way through  a ladder  of leadership  positions.    \\n19.5. While  being  provided  with adequate  funding,  legislative  enablement,  and autonomy  in a phased  \\nmanner,  all HEIs,  in turn, will display  commitment  to institutional  excellence,  engagement  with their ', metadata={'source': '/Users/anupam/Documents/Debtanaya docs/National_Education_Policy_2020.pdf', 'page': 49}),\n",

Each  institution  \\nwill make  a strategic  Institutional  Development  Plan on the basis  of which  institutions  will develop  \\ninitiat ives, assess  their own progress,  and reach the goals  set therein,  which  could  then become  the \\nbasis  for further  public  funding.  The IDP shall  be prepared  with the joint participation  of Board  \\nmembers,  institutional  leaders,  faculty,  students,  and staff.  \\n \\nPart  III. OTHER  KEY  AREAS  OF FOCUS  \\n \\n20. Professional  Education  \\n \\n20.1.  Preparation  of professionals  must  involve  an education  in the ethic  and importance  of public  \\npurpose,  an education  in the discipline,  and an education  for practice.  It must  centrally  involve  critical  \\nand interdisciplinary  thinki ng, discussion,  debate,  research,  and innovation.  For this to be achieved,  \\nprofessional  education  should  not take place  in the isolation  of one's  specialty.   \\n20.2.  Professional  education  thus becomes  an integral  part of the overall  higher  education  system.  \\nStand -alone  agricultural  universities,  legal  universities,  health  science  universities , technical  \\nuniversities,  and stand -alone  institutions  in other  fields,  shall  aim to become  multidisciplin ary \\ninstitutions  offering  holistic  and multidisciplinary  educat ion. All institutions  offering  either  \\nprofessional  or general  education  will aim to organically  evolve  into institutions/clusters  offering  \\nboth seamlessly , and in an integrated  manner  by 2030.  \\n20.3. Agricultural  education  with allied  disciplines  will be revived.  Although  Agricultural  \\nUniversities  comprise  approximately  9% of all universities  in the country,  enrolment  in agriculture  \\nand allied  sciences  is less than 1% of all enrolment  in higher  education.  Both  capacity  and quality  of \\nagriculture  and allied  disciplines  must  be improved  in order  to increase  agricultural  productivity  \\nthrough  better  skilled  graduates  and technicians,  innovative  research,  and market -based  extension  \\nlinked  to technologi es and practices.  The preparation  of professionals  in agricultu re and veterinary  \\nsciences  through  programmes  integrated  with general  education  will be increased  sharply.  The design  \\nof agricultural  education  will shift towards  developing  professionals  with the ability  to understand  \\nand use local  knowledge,  traditional  knowledge,  and emerging  technologies  while  being  cognizant  of \\ncritical  issues  such as declining  land productivity,  climate  change,  food sufficiency  for our growing  \\npopulation,  etc. Institutions  offering  agricultural  education  must  benefit  the local  communi ty directly;  \\none approach  could  be to set up Agricultural  Technology  Parks  to promote  technology  incubation  and \\ndissemination  and promote  sustainable  methodologies.  \\n20.4.  Legal  education  needs  to be competitive  globally,  adopting  best practices  and embraci ng new \\ntechnologies  for wider  access  to and timely  delivery  of justice.  At the same  time,  it must  be informed  \\nand illuminated  with Constitutional  values  of Justice  - Social,  Economic,  and Polit ical - and directed  \\ntowards  national  reconstruction  through  instrumentation  of democracy,  rule of law, and human  rights.  \\nThe curricula  for legal  studies  must  reflect  socio -cultural  contexts  along  with,  in an evidence -based  \\nmanner,  the history  of legal  thinking,  principles  of justice,  the practice  of jurisprudence,  and other  \\nrelated  content  appropriately  and adequately.  State  institutions  offering  law education  must  consider  \\noffering  bilingual  education  for future  lawyers  and judges  - in English  and in the language  of the \\nState  in which  the institution  is situated.   \\n20.5. Healthcare  education  needs  to be re-envisioned  so that the duration,  structure,  and design  of the \\neducational  programmes  need  to match  the role requirements  that graduates  will play.  Student s will \\nbe assessed  at regular  intervals  on well-defined  paramet ers primarily  required  for working  in primary  \\ncare and in secondary  hospitals.  Given  that people  exercise  pluralistic  choices  in healthcare,  our \\nhealthcare  education  system  must  be integrative  meaning  thereby  that all students  of allopathic  \\nmedical  educati on must  have  a basic  understanding  of Ayurveda,  Yoga  and Naturopathy,  Unani,  \\nSiddha,  and Homeopathy  (AYUSH),  and vice versa.  There  shall  also be a much  greater  emphasis  on \\npreventive  healthcare  and community  medicine  in all forms  of healthcare  education.  \", metadata={'source': '/Users/anupam/Documents/Debtanaya docs/National_Education_Policy_2020.pdf', 'page': 50}),\n",

Technical  education  includes  degree  and diploma  programmes  in, engineering,  technology,  \\nmanagement,  architecture,  town  planning,  pharmacy,  hotel  management,  catering  technology  etc., \\nwhich  are critical  to India  ’s overall  development.  There  will not only be a greater  demand  for well-\\nqualified  manpower  in these  sectors , it will also require  closer  collaborations  between  industry  and \\nhigher  education  institutions  to drive  innovation  and research  in these  fields.  Furthermore,  influence  \\nof technology  on human endeavours  is expected  to erode  the silos between  technical  education  and \\nother  disciplines  too. Technical  education  will, thus, also aim to be offered  within  multidisciplinary  \\neducati on institutions  and programmes  and have a renewed  focus  on opportunit ies to engage  deeply  \\nwith other  disciplines.  India  must  also take the lead in preparing  professionals  in cutting -edge  areas  \\nthat are fast gaining  prominence,  such as Artificial  Intelligen ce (AI),  3-D machining,  big data \\nanalysis,  and machine  learning,  in addition  to genomic  studies,  biotechnology,  nanotechnology,  \\nneuroscience,  with important  applications  to health,  environment,  and sustainable  living  that will be \\nwoven  into undergraduate  education  for  enhancing   the employability  of the youth.  \\n21. Adult  Education  and Lifelong  Learning  \\n21.1.  The opportunity  to attain  foundational  literacy,  obtain  an education,  and pursue  a livelihood  \\nmust  be viewed  as basic  rights  of every  citizen.  Literacy  and basic  education  open  up whole  new \\nworlds  of personal,  civic,  economic,  and lifelong -learning  opportunities  for individuals  that enable  \\nthem  to progress  personally  and professionally.  At the level  of society  and the nation,  literacy  and \\nbasic  education  are powerful  force  multipliers  which  greatly  enhance  the success  of all other  \\ndevelopmental  efforts.  Worldwide  data on nations  indicate  extremely  high correlations  between  \\nliteracy  rates  and per capita  GDP.  \\n21.2.  Meanwhile,  being  a non-literate  member  of a community , has innumerable  disadvantages,  \\nincluding  the inability  to: carry  out basic  financial  transactions;  compare  the quality/quantity  of goods  \\npurchased  against  the price  charged;  fill out forms  to apply  for jobs,  loans,  services,  etc.; comprehend  \\npublic  circulars  and articles  in the news  media;  use conventional  and electronic  mail to communicate  \\nand conduct  business;  make  use of the internet  and other  technology  to improve  one’s life and \\nprofession;  comprehend  directions  and safety  directives  on the street,  on medicines,  etc.; help \\nchildren  with their education;  be aware  of one ’s basic  rights  and responsibilities  as a citizen  of India;  \\nappreciate  works  of literature;  and pursue  employment  in medium  or high-productivity  sectors  that \\nrequire  literacy.  The abilities  listed  here are an illustrative  list of outcomes  to be achieved  through  \\nadoption  of innovative  measures  for Adult  Education.  \\n21.3.  Extensive  field studies  and analyses,  both in India  and across  the world,  clearly  demonstrate  \\nthat volunteerism  and community  involvement  and mobilization  are key success  factors  of adult  \\nliteracy  programmes,  in conjunction  with political  will, organ izational  structure,  proper  planning,  \\nadequate  financial  support,  and high-quality  capacity  building  of educators  and volunteers.  \\nSuccessful  literacy  programmes  result  not only in the growth  of literacy  among  adults,  but also result  \\nin increased  demand  for education  for all children  in the community,  as well as greater  community  \\ncontribution  to positive  social  change.  The National  Literacy  Mission,  when  it was launched  in 1988,  \\nwas largel y based  on the voluntary  involvement  and support  of the people,  and resulted  in significant  \\nincreases  in national  literacy  during  the period  of 1991–2011,  including  among  women,  and also \\ninitiated  dialogue  and discussions  on pertinent  social  issues  of the day. \\n21.4.  Strong  and innovative  government  initiatives  for adult  educ ation  - in particular,  to facilitate  \\ncommunity  involvement  and the smooth  and beneficial  integration  of technology  - will be affected  as \\nsoon  as possible  to expedite  this all-important  aim of achieving  100%  literacy.  \\n21.5.  First,  an outstanding  adult  educa tion curriculum  framework  will be developed  by a new and \\nwell-supported  constituent  body  of the NCERT  that is dedicated  to adult  education,  so as to develop  \\nsynergy  with and build  upon  NCERT ’s existing  expertise  in establishing  outstanding  curricula  for \\nliteracy,  numeracy,  basic  education,  vocational  skills,  and beyond.  The curriculum  framework  for \\nadult  education  will include  at least five types  of programmes,  each with clearly  defined  outcomes:  \\n(a) foundational  literacy  and numeracy;  (b) critical  life skills (including  financial  literacy,  digital  \\nliteracy,  commercial  skills,  health  care and awareness,  child  care and education,  and family  welfare);  ', metadata={'source': '/Users/anupam/Documents/Debtanaya docs/National_Education_Policy_2020.pdf', 'page': 51}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=' \\n \\nNational  Education  Policy  2020  \\n52 \\n (c) vocational  skills  development  (with  a view  towards  obtaining  local  employment);  (d) basic  \\neducation  (inclu ding preparatory,  middle,  and secondary  stage  equivalency);  and (e) continuing  \\neducation  (including  engaging  holistic  adult  education  courses  in arts, sciences,  technology,  culture,  \\nsports, and recreation,  as well as other  topics  of interest  or use to local learners,  such as more  \\nadvanced  material  on critical  life skills).  The framework  would  keep  in mind  that adults  in many  \\ncases  will require  rather  different  teaching -learning  methods  and materials  than those  designed  for \\nchildren.  \\n21.6.  Second,  suitable  infrastructure  will be ensured  so that all interested  adults  will have  access  to \\nadult  education  and lifelong  learning.  A key initiative  in this direction  will be to use schools / school  \\ncomplexes  after school  hours  and on weekends  and public  library  spaces  for adult  education  courses  \\nwhich  will be ICT-equipped  when  possible  and for other  community  engagement  and enrichment  \\nactivities.  The sharing  of infrastructure  for school,  higher,  adult , and vocational  education,  and for \\nother  community  and volunteer  activities,  will be critical  for ensuring  efficient  use of both physical  \\nand human  resources  as well as for creating  synergy  among  these  five types  of education  and beyond.  \\nFor these  reasons , Adult  Education  Centres  (AECs)  could  also be included  within  other  public  \\ninstitutions  such as HEIs,  vocational  training  centres,  etc. \\n21.7.  Third,  the instructors/educators  will be required  to deliver  the curriculum  framework  to mature  \\nlearners  for all five types  of adult  education  as described  in the Adult  Education  Curriculum  \\nFramework . These instructors  will be trained  by the National,  State,  and district  level  resource  \\nsupport  institutions  to organize  and lead learning  activities  at Adult  Education  Centres,  as well as \\ncoordinate  with volunteer  instructors.  Qualified  community  members  including  from  HEIs  as part of \\neach HEI’s mission  to engage  with their local  communities  will be encouraged  and welcomed  to take \\na short  training  course  and volunteer,  as adult  literacy  instructors,  or to serve  as one-on-one volunteer  \\ntutor s, and will be recognized  for their critical  service  to the nation.  States  will also work  with NGOs  \\nand other  community  organi zations  to enhance  efforts  towards  literacy  and adult  educat ion. \\n21.8.  Fourth,  all efforts  will be undertaken  to ensure  the participation  of community  members  in adult  \\neducation.  Social  workers/ counsellors  travelling  through  their communities  to track  and ensure  \\nparticipation  of non-enrolled  students  and dropouts  will also be requested,  during  their travels,  to \\ngather  data of parents,  adolescents,  and others  interested  in adult  education  opportunities  both as \\nlearners  and as teachers/tutors . The social  workers/ counsellors  will then connect  them  with local  \\nAdult  Educ ation  Centres  (AECs).  Opportunities  for adult  education  will also be widely  publicized , \\nthrough  advertisements  and announcements  and through  events  and initiatives  of NGOs  and other  \\nlocal  organizations . \\n21.9.  Fifth,  improving  the availability  and accessibi lity of books  is essential  to inculcating  the habit  of \\nreading  within  our communities  and educational  institutions.  This Policy  recommends  that all \\ncommunities  and education al institutions  - schools,  colleges , universities  and public  libraries  - will be \\nstrengt hened  and moderni zed to ensure  an adequate  supply  of books  that cater  to the needs  and \\ninterests  of all students,  including  persons  with disabilities  and other  differently -abled  persons.  The \\nCentral  and State  governments  will take steps  to ensure  that book s are made  accessible  and affordable  \\nto all across  the country  including  socio -economically  disadvantaged  areas  as well as those  living  in \\nrural  and remote  areas.  Both  public  and private  sector  agencies/institutions  will devise  strategies  to \\nimprove  the quality and attractiveness  of books  published  in all Indian  languages.  Steps  will be taken  \\nto enhance  online  accessibility  of library  books  and further  broad  basing  of digital  libraries.  For \\nensuring  vibrant  libraries  in communities  and educational  institutions, it will be imperative  to make  \\navailable  adequate  library  staff and also devise  appropriate  career  pathways  and CPD  for them . Other  \\nsteps  will include  strengthening  all existing  libraries,  setting  up rural  libraries  and reading  rooms  in \\ndisadvanta ged regions,  making  widely  available  reading  material  in Indian  languages,  opening  \\nchildren ’s libraries  and mobile  libraries , establishing  social  book  clubs  across  India  and across  \\nsubjects,  and fostering  greater  collaborations  between  education  institutio ns and libraries.  \\n21.10.

In many  cases,  quality  adult  education  could  thereby  be conducted  in an online  or \\nblended  mode.  \\n22. Promotion  of Indian  Languages,  Arts,  and Culture  \\n22.1.  India  is a treasure  trove  of culture , developed  over thousands  of years  and mani fested  in the \\nform  of arts, works  of literature,  customs,  traditions,  linguistic  expressions,  artefa cts, heritage  sites,  \\nand more.  Crores  of people  from  around  the world  partake  in, enjoy,  and benefit  from  this cultural  \\nwealth  daily,  in the form  of visitin g India  for tourism,  experiencing  Indian  hospitality,  purchasing  \\nIndia ’s handicrafts  and handmade  textiles,  reading  the classical  literature  of India,  practicing  yoga  \\nand meditation,  being  inspired  by Indian  philosophy,  participating  in India ’s unique  festivals,  \\nappreciating  India ’s diverse  music  and art, and watching  Indian  films,  amongst  many  other  aspects. It \\nis this cultural  and natural  wealth  that truly  makes  India,  “Incredible  !ndia”,  as per India ’s tourism  \\nslogan.  The preservation  and promotion  of India ’s cultural  wealth  must  be considered  a high priority  \\nfor the country,  as it is truly  important  for the nation  ’s identity  as well as for its economy.  \\n22.2.  The promotion  of Indian  arts and culture  is important  not only for the nation  but also for the \\nindividual.  Cultural  awareness  and expression  are among  the major  competencies  considered  \\nimportant  to develop  in children,  in order  to provide  them  with a sense  of identity,  belonging,  as well \\nas an appreciation  of other  cultures  and identities.  It is throu gh the development  of a strong  sense  and \\nknowledge  of their own cultural  history,  arts, languages,  and traditions  that children  can build  a \\npositive  cultural  identity  and self-esteem.  Thus , cultural  awareness  and expression  are important  \\ncontributors  both to individual  as well as societal  well-being.  \\n22.3.  The arts form  a major  medium  for imparting  cultu re. The arts - besides  strengthening  cultural  \\nidentity , awareness,  and uplifting  societies  - are well known  to enhance  cognitive  and creative  \\nabilities  in individuals  and increase  individual  happiness . The happiness/well -being,  cognitive  \\ndevelopment,  and cultural  identity  of individuals  are important  reasons  that Indian  arts of all kinds  \\nmust  be offered  to students  at all levels  of education,  starting  with early  childhood  care and \\neducation.  \\n22.4.  Language,  of course,  is inextricably  linked  to art and cultu re. Different  languages  ‘see ’ the \\nworld  differently,  and the structure  of a language,  therefore,  determines  a native  speaker  ’s perception  \\nof experience.  In particular,  languages  influence  the way people  of a given  culture  speak  with others,  \\nincluding  with family  members,  authority  figures,  peers,  and strangers , and influence  the tone of \\nconversation.  The tone,  perception  of experience,  and familiarity/ ‘apnapan’   inherent  in \\nconversations  among  speakers  of a common  language  are a reflection  and record  of a culture.  Culture  \\nis, thus, encased  in our languages.  Art, in the form  of literature,  plays,  music,  film,  etc. cannot  be \\nfully  appreciated  without  language.  In order  to preserve  and promote  culture,  one must  preserve  and \\npromote  a culture ’s languages.   \\n22.5.  Unfortunately,  Indian  languages  have  not received  their due attention  and care,  with the country  \\nlosing  over 220 languages  in the last 50 years  alone.  UNESCO  has declared  197 Indian  languages  as \\n‘endangered  ’. Various  unscripted  languages  are particularly  in danger  of becoming  extinct.  When  \\nsenior  member(s)  of a tribe or community  that speak  such languages  pass away,  these  languages  often  \\nperish  with them;  too often,  no concerted  actions  or measures  are taken  to preserve  or record  these  \\nrich languages/expre ssions  of culture.   \\n22.6.  Moreover,  even  those  languages  of India  that are not officially  on such endangered  lists, such as \\nthe 22 languages  of Eighth  Schedule  of the Constitution  of India , are facing  serious  difficulties  on \\nmany  fronts.  Teaching  and learn ing of Indian  languages  need  to be integrated  with school  and higher  \\neducation  at every  level.  For languages  to remain  relevant  and vibrant,  there  must  be a steady  stream  \\nof high-quality  learning  and print  materials  in these  languages  including  textbooks,  workbooks,  \\nvideos,  plays,  poems,  novels, magazines,  etc. Languages  must  also have  consistent  official  updates  to \\ntheir vocabularies  and dictionaries,  widely  disseminated,  so that the most  current  issues  and concepts  \\ncan be effectively  discussed  in these  languages.  Enabling  such learning  materials,  print  materials,  and ', metadata={'source': '/Users/anupam/Documents/Debtanaya docs/National_Education_Policy_2020.pdf', 'page': 53}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=' \\n \\nNational  Education  Policy  2020  \\n54 \\n translations  of important  materials  from  world  languages,  and constantly  updating  vocabularies,  are \\ncarried  out by countries  around  the world  for languages  such as English,  French,  German,  Hebrew, \\nKorean,  and Japanese . However,  India  has remained  quite  slow  in producing  such learning  and print \\nmaterials  and dictionaries  to help keep  its languages  optimally  vibrant  and current  with integrity.  \\n22.7.  Additionally,  there  has been  a severe  scarcity  of skilled  language  teachers  in India, despite  \\nvarious  measures  being  taken.  Language -teaching  too must  be improved  to be more  experiential  and \\nto focus  on the ability  to converse  and interact  in the language  and not just on the literature,  \\nvocabulary,  and grammar  of the language.  Languages  must  be used more  extensively  for \\nconversation  and for teaching -learning.  \\n22.8.  A number  of initiatives  to foster  languages,  arts, and culture  in school  children  have been \\ndiscussed  in Chapter  4, which  include   a greater  emphasis  on music,  arts, and crafts throughout  all \\nlevels  of school;  early  implementation  of the three -language  formula  to promote  multilingualism ; \\nteaching  in the home/local  language  wherever  possible ; conducting  more  experiential  language  \\nlearning;  the hiring  of outstanding  local  artists , writers,  craftspersons,  and other  experts  as  master  \\ninstructors  in various  subjects  of local  expertise;  accurate  inclusion  of traditional  Indian  knowledge  \\nincluding  tribal  and other  local  knowledge  throughout  into the curriculum,  across   humanities,  \\nsciences,  arts, crafts,  and sports,  whenever  relevant;  and a much  greater  flexibility  in the curriculum,  \\nespecially  in secondary  schools  and in higher  education,  so that students  can choose  the ideal  balance  \\namong  courses  for themselves  to develop  their own creative,  artistic,  cultural,  and academic  paths.   \\n22.9.  To enable  the key latter  initiatives,  a number  of further  actions  will be taken  in tandem  at the \\nhigher  education  level  and beyond.  First,  to develop  and teach  many  of the courses  of the type \\nmentione d above,  an excellent  team  of teachers  and faculty  will have  to be developed.  Strong  \\ndepartments  and programmes  in Indian  languages,  comparative  literature,  creative  writing,  arts, \\nmusic,  philosophy,  etc. will be launched  and developed  across  the country,  and degrees  including  4-\\nyear B.Ed.  dual degrees  will be developed  in these  subjects.  These  departments  and programmes  will, \\nin particular  help to develop  a large  cadre  of high-quality  language  teachers  - as well as teache rs of \\nart, music,  philosophy  and writing - who will be needed  around  the country  to carry  out this Policy.  \\nThe NRF  will fund quality  research  in all these  areas.  Outstanding  local  artists  and craftspersons  will \\nbe hired  as guest  faculty  to promote  local  music, art, languages,  and handicraft , and to ensure  that \\nstudents  are aware  of the culture  and local  knowledge  where  they study.  Every  higher  education  \\ninstitution  and even  every  school  or school  complex  will aim to have Artist(s) -in-Residence  to expose  \\nstudents  to art, creativity,  and the rich treasures  of the region/country.  \\n22.10.  More  HEIs,  and more  programmes  in higher  education,  will use the mother  tongue/local  \\nlanguage  as a medium  of instruction,  and/or  offer  programmes  bilingually,  in order  to increa se access  \\nand GER  and also to promo te the strength,  usage,  and vibrancy  of all Indian  languages . Private  HEIs  \\ntoo will be encouraged  and incentivized  to use Indian  languages  as medi um of instruction  and/or  \\noffer  bilingual  programmes.  Four -year B.Ed.  dual degree  programmes  offered  bilingually  will also \\nhelp,  e.g. in training  cadres  of science  and mathematics  teachers  to teach  science  bilingually  at \\nschools  across  the country.   \\n22.11.  High -quality  programmes  and degrees  in Translation  and Interpretation,  Art and Museum  \\nAdministratio n, Archaeology,  Artefact  Conservation,  Graphic  Design,  and Web  Design  within  the \\nhigher  education  system  will also be created.  In order  to preserve  and promote  its art and culture,  \\ndevelop  high-quality  materials  in various  Indian  languages,  conserve  artefa cts, develop  highly  \\nqualified  individuals  to curate  and run museums  and heritage  or tourist  sites, thereby  also vastly  \\nstrengthening  the tourism  industry.  \\n22.12.  The Policy  recogni zes that the knowledge  of the rich diversity  of India should  be imbibed  first \\nhand  by learners.  This would  mean  including  simple  activities,  like touring  by students  to different  \\nparts  of the country,  which  will not only give a boost  to tourism  but will also lead to an understanding  \\nand appreciation  of diversity,  culture,  traditio ns and knowledge  of different  parts  of India.

Creating  such programmes  and degrees  in higher  education,  across  the arts, langu ages,  and \\nhumanities,  will also come  with expanded  high-quality  opportunities  for employment  that can make  \\neffective  use of these  qualifications.  There  are already  hundreds  of Academies,  museums,  art \\ngalleries,  and heritage  sites in dire need  of qualified  individuals  for their effective  functioning.  As \\npositions  are filled  with suitably  qualified  candidates,  and further  artefacts  are procured  and \\nconserved , additional  museums,  including  virtual  museums/e -museums,  galleries,  and heritage  sites \\nmay contribute  to the conservation  of our heritage  as well as to India ’s tourism  industry.  \\n22.14. India  will also urgently  expand  its translation  and interpretation  efforts  in order  to make  high-\\nquality  learning  materials  and other  important  written  and spoken  material  available  to the public  in \\nvarious  Indian  and foreign  languages.  For this, an Indian  Institute  of Translation  and Interpretation  \\n(IITI)  will be established.  Such  an institute  would  provide  a truly  important  service  for the country,  as \\nwell as employ  numero us multilingual  language  and subject  experts,  and experts  in translation  and \\ninterpretation,  which  will help to promote  all Indian  languages.  The IITI shall  also make  extensive  \\nuse of technology  to aid in its translation  and interpretation  efforts.  The IITI could  naturally  grow  \\nwith time,  and be housed  in multiple  locations  including  in HEIs  to facilitate  collaborations  with \\nother  research  departments  as demand  and the number  of qualified  candidates  grows.  \\n22.15. Due to its vast and significant  contribution s and literature  across  genres  and subjects,  its \\ncultural  significance,  and its scientific  nature,  rather  than being  restricted  to single -stream  Sanskrit  \\nPathshalas  and Universities,  Sanskrit  will be mainstreamed  with strong  offerings  in school  - including  \\nas one of the language  options  in the three -language  formula  - as well as in higher  education . It will \\nbe taught  not in isolation,  but in interesting  and innovative  ways,  and connected  to other  \\ncontemporary  and relevant  subjects  such as mathematics,  astro nomy,  philosophy,  linguistics,  \\ndramatics,  yoga,  etc. Thus,  in consonance  with the rest of this policy,  Sanskrit  Universities  too will \\nmove  towards  becoming  large  multidisciplinary  institutions  of higher  learning . Departments  of \\nSanskrit  that conduct  teachi ng and outstandin g interdisciplinary  research  on Sanskrit  and Sanskrit  \\nKnowledge  Systems  will be established/strengthened  across  the new multidisciplinary  higher  \\neducation  system.  Sanskrit  will become  a natural  part of a holistic  multidisciplinary  higher  education  \\nif a student so chooses.   Sanskrit  teachers  in large  numbers  will be professionalized  across  the \\ncountry  in mission  mode  through  the offering  of 4-year integrated  multidisciplinary  B.Ed.  dual \\ndegrees  in education  and Sanskrit.  \\n22.16. India  will similarly  expand  its institutes  and universities  studying  all classical  languages  and \\nliterature,  with strong  efforts  to collect,  preserve,  translate,  and study  the tens of thousands  of \\nmanuscripts  that have not yet received  their due attention.  Sanskrit  and all Indian  langu age institutes  \\nand departments  across  the country  will be significantly  strengthened,  with adequate  training  given  to \\nlarge  new batches  of students  to study,  in particular,  the large  numbers  of manuscripts  and their \\ninterrelations  with other subjects.  Classical language  institutes  will aim to be merged  with \\nuniversities,  while  maintaining  their autonomy,  so that faculty  may work , and students  too may be \\ntrained  as part of robust  and rigorous  multidisciplinary  programmes.  Universities  dedica ted to \\nlanguages  will become  multidisciplinary,  towards  the same  end; where  relevant,  they may then also \\noffer  B.Ed.  dual degrees  in education  and a language , to develop  outstanding  language  teachers  in \\nthat language.  Further,  it is also proposed  that a new institution  for Languages  will be established.  \\nNational  Institute  (or Institutes)  for Pali, Persian  and Prakrit  will also be set up within  a university  \\ncampus . Similar  initiatives  will be carried  out for institutes  and universities  studying  Indian  arts, art \\nhistory,  and Indology.  Research  for outstanding  work  in all these  areas  will be supported  by the NRF.  \\n22.17. Efforts  to preserve  and promote  all Indian  languages  including  classical,  tribal  and endangered  \\nlanguages  will be taken  on with new vigour . Technology  and crowd sourcing,  with extensive  \\nparticipation  of the people,  will play a crucial  role in these  efforts.  \\n22.18.

These  dictionaries  would  be widely  disseminated,  for use in education,  journalism,  writing,  \\nspeechmaking,  and beyond,  and would  be available  on the web as well as in book  form.  These  \\nAcademies  for Eighth  Schedule  languages  will be established  by the Central  Government  in \\nconsultation  or collaboration  with State  Gove rnments.  Academies  for other  highly  spoken  Indian  \\nlanguages  may also be similarly  established  by the Centre  and/or  States.  \\n22.19. All languages  in India,  and their associated  arts and culture  will be documented  through  a \\nweb-based  platform/porta l/wiki,  in order  to preserve  endangered  and all Indian  languages  and their \\nassociated  rich local  arts and culture.  The platform  will contain  videos,  dictionaries,  recordings,  and \\nmore,  of people  (especially  elders)  speaking  the language,  telling  stories,  reciting  poetry, and \\nperforming  plays,  folk songs  and dances,  and more.  People  from  across  the country  will be invited  to \\ncontribute  to these  efforts  by adding  relevant  material  onto these  platforms/portals/wikis.  Universities  \\nand their research  teams  will work  with each other  and with communities  across  the country  towards  \\nenriching such platforms.  These  preservation  efforts,  and the associated  research  projects,  e.g., in \\nhistory,  archaeology,  linguistics,  etc., will be funded  by the NRF.  \\n22.20. Scholarship s for peopl e of all ages to study  Indian  Languages,  Arts,  and Culture  with local  \\nmasters  and/or  within  the higher  education  system  will be established.   The promotion  of Indian  \\nlanguages  is possible  only if they are used regularly  and if they are used for teaching  and learning.  \\nIncentives,  such as prizes  for outstanding  poetry  and prose  in Indian  languages  across  categories,  will \\nbe established  to ensure  vibrant  poetry,  novels,  nonfiction  books,  textbooks,  journalism,  and other  \\nworks  in all Indian  languages . Proficien cy in Indian  languages  will be included  as part of \\nqualification  parameters  for employment  opportunities.    \\n23. Technology  Use and Integration  \\n23.1.  India  is a global  leader  in information  and communication  technology  and in other  cutting -edge  \\ndomains , such as space.  The Digital  India  Campaign  is helping  to transform  the entire  nation  into a \\ndigitally  empowered  society  and knowledge  economy.  Whil e education  will play a critical  role in this \\ntransformation,  technology  itself  will play an important  role in the improvement  of educational  \\nprocesses  and outcomes;  thus,  the relationship  between  technology  and education  at all levels  is bi-\\ndirectional.  \\n23.2. Given  the explosive  pace of technological  development  allied  with the sheer  creativity  of tech-\\nsavvy teachers  and entrepreneurs  including  student  entrepreneurs , it is certain  that technology  will \\nimpact  education  in multiple  ways,  only some  of which  can be foreseen  at the present  time.  New \\ntechnologies  involving  artificial  intelligence,  machine  learni ng, block  chains,  smart  boards,  handheld  \\ncomputing  devices,  adaptive  computer  testing  for student  development,  and other  forms  of \\neducational  software  and hardware  will not just change  what  students  learn  in the classroom  but how \\nthey learn,  and thus these  areas  and beyond  will require  extensive  research  both on the technological  \\nas well as educational  fronts.  \\n23.3.  Use and integration  of technology  to improve  multiple  aspects  of education  will be supported  \\nand adopted,  provided  these  interventions  are rigorously  and transparently  evaluated  in relevant  \\ncontexts  before  they are scaled  up. An autonomous  body,  the National  Educational  Technology  \\nForum  (NETF),  will be created  to provide  a platform  for the free exchange  of ideas  on the use of \\ntechnology  to enhanc e learning,  assessment,  planning,  administration,  and so on, both for school  and \\nhigher  education.  The aim of the NETF  will be to facilitate  decision  making  on the induction,  \\ndeployment,  and use of technology,  by providing  to the leadership  of education  institutions,  State  and \\nCentral  governments,  and other  stakeholde rs, the latest  knowledge  and research  as well as the \\nopportunity  to consult  and share  best practices .

To remain  relevant  in the fast-changing  field of educatio nal technology,  the NETF  will maintain  \\na regular  inflow  of authentic  data from  multiple  sources  including  educational  technology  innovators  \\nand practitioners  and will engage  with a diverse  set of researchers  to analyze  the data. To support  the \\ndevelopment  of a vibrant  body  of knowledge  and practice,  the NETF  will organize  multiple  regional  \\nand national  conferences,  workshops,  etc. to solicit  inputs  from  national  and international  educational  \\ntechnology  researchers,  entrepreneurs,  and practitioners.  \\n23.5.  The thrust  of technological  interventions  will be for the purposes  of improving  teaching -\\nlearning  and evaluation  processes,  supporting  teacher  preparation  and professional  development,  \\nenhancing  educational  access,  and streamlining  educational  planni ng, management,  and \\nadministration  including  processes  related  to admissions,  attendance,  assessments,  etc. \\n23.6.  A rich variety  of educational  software,  for all the above  purposes,  will be developed  and made  \\navailable  for students  and teachers  at all levels. All such software  will be available  in all major  Indian  \\nlanguages  and will be accessible  to a wide  range  of users  including  students  in remote  areas  and \\nDivyang  students . Teaching -learning  e-conten t will continue  to be developed  by all States  in all \\nregional  languages,  as well as by the NCERT , CIET , CBSE,  NIOS,  and other  bodies/institutions,  and \\nwill be uploaded  onto the DIKSHA  platform.  This platform  may also be utilized  for Teacher  ’s \\nProfessional  Development  through  e-content . CIET  will be strengthened  to promote  and expand  \\nDIKSHA  as well as other  education  technology  initiatives.  Suitable  equipment  will be made  available  \\nto teachers  at schools  so that teachers  can suitably  integrate  e-contents  into teaching -learning  \\npractices . Technology -based  education  platforms,  such as DIKSHA/SWAYAM,  will be better  \\nintegrated  across  school  and higher  education,  and will include  ratings /reviews  by users,  so as to \\nenable  content  developers  create  user friendly  and qualitative  content.   \\n23.7.  Particular  attention  will need  to be paid to emerging  disruptive  technologies  that will \\nnecessarily  transform  the education  system . When  the 1986/1992  National  Policy  on Education  was \\nformulated,  it was difficult  to predict  the disruptive  effect  that the internet  would  have  brought.  Our \\npresent  education  system's  inability  to cope  with these  rapid  and disruptive  changes  places  us \\nindividually  and nationally  at a perilous  disadvantage  in an increasingly  competitive  world.  For \\nexample,  while  computers  have  largely  surpassed  humans  in leveraging  factual  and procedural  \\nknowledge,  our education  at all levels  excessively  burdens  students  with such knowledge  at the \\nexpense  of developing  their higher -order  competencies.  \\n23.8.  This policy  has been  formulated  at a time when  an unquestionably  disruptive  technology  -\\nArtificial  Intelligence  (AI) 3D/7D  Virtual  Reality  - has emerged.  As the cost of AI-based  prediction  \\nfalls,  AI will be able to match  or outperform  and, therefore , be a valuable  aid to even  skilled  \\nprofessiona ls such as doctors  in certain  predictive  tasks.  AI's disruptive  potential  in the workplace  is \\nclear,  and the education  system  must  be poised  to respond  quickly.  One of the permanent  tasks  of the \\nNETF  will be to categorize  emerg ent technologies  based  on their potential  and estimated  timeframe  \\nfor disruption,  and to periodically  present  this analysis  to MHRD.  Based  on these  inputs,  MHRD  will \\nformally  identify  those  technologies  whose  emergence  demands  responses  from  the education  \\nsystem.   \\n23.9.  In response  to MHRD's  formal  recognition  of a new disruptive  technology,  the National  \\nResearch  Foundation  will initiate  or expand  research  efforts  in the technology . In the context  of AI, \\nNRF  may consider  a three -pronged  approach:  (a) advanc ing core AI research,  (b) developing  and \\ndeploying  application -based  research,  and (c) advancing  international  research  efforts  to address  \\nglobal  challenges  in areas  such as healthcare,  agriculture,  and climate  change  using  AI. \", metadata={'source': '/Users/anupam/Documents/Debtanaya docs/National_Education_Policy_2020.pdf', 'page': 57}),\n",

Disruptive  technologies  will make certain  jobs redundant,  and hence  approaches  to skilling  \\nand deskilling  that are both efficient  and ensure  quality  will be of increasing  importance  to create  and \\nsustain  employment.  Institutions  will have  autonomy  to approve  institutional  and non-institutional  \\npartners  to deliver  such training,  which  will be integrated  with skills  and higher  education  \\nframeworks.  \\n23.11.  Universities  will aim to offer  Ph.D.  and Masters  programmes  in core areas  such as Machine  \\nLearning  as well as multidisciplinary  fields  “AI + X” and professional  areas  like health  care, \\nagriculture,  and law. They  may also develop  and disseminate  courses  in these  areas  via platforms,  \\nsuch as SWAYAM.  For rapid  adoption,  HEIs  may blend  these  online  courses  with traditional  \\nteaching  in undergr aduate  and vocational  programmes.

Efforts  to teach  languages  to school  students  will be dovetailed  with efforts  to \\nenhance  Natural  Language  Processing  for India ’s diverse  languages.  \\n23.12.  As disruptive  technologies  emerge,  schooling  and continuing  education  will assist  in raising  \\nthe general  populace  ’s awareness  of their potential  disruptive  effects  and will also address  related  \\nissues.

In school,  the study  of current  affairs  and ethical  issues  will includ e a discussion  on \\ndisruptive  technolo gies such as those  identified  by NETF/MHRD.  Appropriate  instructional  and \\ndiscussion  materials  will also be prepared  for continuing  education.  \\n23.13.  Data  is a key fuel for AI-based  technologies,  and it is critical  to raise awareness  on issues  of \\nprivacy,  laws,  and standards  associated  with data handling  and data protection,  etc. It is also \\nnecessary  to highlight  ethical  issues  surrounding  the development  and deployment  of AI-based  \\ntechnologies.  Education  will play a key role in these  awareness  raising  efforts. Other  disruptive  \\ntechnologies  that are expected  to change  the way we live, and, therefore , change  the way we educate  \\nstudents,  include  those  relating  to clean  and renewable  energy,  water  conservation,  sustainable  \\nfarming,  environmental  preservation,  and other  green  initiatives;  these  will also receive  prioritized  \\nattention  in education.  \\n24. Online  and Digital  Education :  Ensuring  Equitable  Use of Technology  \\n24.1.  New  circumstances  and realities  require  new initiatives.  The recent  rise in epidemics  and \\npandemics  necessitates  that we are ready  with alternative  modes  of quality  education  whenever  and \\nwherever  traditional  and in-person  modes  of education  are not possible.  In this regard,  the National  \\nEducation  Policy  2020  recogni zes the importance  of levera ging the advantages  of technology  while  \\nacknowledging  its potential  risks  and dangers.   It calls for carefully  designed  and appropriately  scaled  \\npilot studies  to determine  how the benefits  of online/digital  education  can be reaped  while  addressing  \\nor mitig ating  the downsides.  In the meantime,  the existing  digital  platforms  and ongoing  ICT-based  \\neducational  initiatives  must  be optimized  and expanded  to meet  the current  and future  challenges  in \\nproviding  quality  education  for all.  \\n24.2.  However,  the benefits  of online/digital  education  cannot  be leveraged  unless  the digital  divide  is \\neliminated  through  concerted  efforts,  such as the Digital  India  campaign  and the availability  of \\naffordable  computing  devices.  It is important  that the use of technology  for online and digital  \\neducation  adequately  addresses  concerns  of equity.   \\n24.3.  Teachers  require  suitable  training  and development  to be effective  online  educators.  It cannot  be \\nassumed  that a good  teacher  in a tradit ional  classroom  will automatically  be a good  teacher  in an \\nonline  classroom.  Aside  from  changes  required  in pedagogy,  online  assessments  also require  a ', metadata={'source': '/Users/anupam/Documents/Debtanaya docs/National_Education_Policy_2020.pdf', 'page': 58}),\n",

There  are numerous  challenges  to conducting  online  examinations  at scale,  \\nincluding  limitations  on the types  of questions  that can be asked  in an online  environment,  handling  \\nnetwork  and power  disruptions,  and preventing  unethical  practices.  Certain  types  of courses/subjects,  \\nsuch as performing  arts and science  practical  have  limitations  in the online/digital  education  space,  \\nwhich  can be overcome  to a partial  extent  with innovative  measures.  Further,  unless  online  education  \\nis blended  with experiential  and activity -based  learning,  it will tend to become  a screen -based  \\neducation  with limit ed focus  on the social,  affective  and psychomo tor dimensions  of learning.  \\n24.4.  Given  the emergence  of digital  technologies  and the emerging  importance  of leveraging  \\ntechnology  for teaching -learning  at all levels  from  school  to higher  education , this Policy  \\nrecommends  the following  key initiatives:   \\n \\n(a) Pilot  studies  for online  education : Appropriate  agencies,  such as the NETF,  CIET,  NIOS,  \\nIGNOU,  IITs,  NITs,  etc. will be identified  to conduct  a series  of pilot studies,  in parallel,  to \\nevaluate  the benefits  of integrating  education  with online  educatio n while  mitigating  the \\ndownsides  and also to study  related  areas,  such as, student  device  addiction,  most  preferred  \\nformat s of e-content,  etc.  The results  of these  pilot studies  will be publicly  communicated  and \\nused for continuous  improvement.  \\n(b) Digita l infrastructure : There  is a need  to invest  in creation  of open,  interoperable,  evolvable,  \\npublic  digital  infrastructure  in the education  sector  that can be used by multiple  platforms  and \\npoint  solutions,  to solve  for India’s  scale,  diversity,  complexity  and device  penetration.  This will \\nensure  that the technology -based  solutions  do not become  outdated  with the rapid  advances  in \\ntechnology.  \\n \\n(c) Online  teaching  platform  and tools : Appropriate  existing  e-learning  platforms  such as \\nSWAYAM,  DIKSHA,  will be extended  to provide  teachers  with a structured,  user-friendly,  rich \\nset of assistive  tools  for monitoring  progress  of learners.  Tools,  such as, two-way video  and two-\\nway-audio  interface  for holding  online  classes  are a real necessity  as the present  pandemic  has \\nshown.  \\n \\n(d) Content  creation,  digital  repository,  and dissemination : A digital  repository  of content  \\nincluding  creation  of coursework,  Learning Games  & Simulations,  Augmented  Reality  and \\nVirtual  Reality  will be developed,  with a clear  public  system  for ratings  by users  on effectiveness  \\nand quality.  For fun based  learning  student -appropriate  tools  like apps,  gamification  of Indian  art \\nand culture, in multiple  languages,  with clear  operating  instructions , will also be created.  A \\nreliable  backup  mechanism  for disseminating  e-content  to students  will be provided.  \\n \\n(e) Addressing  the digital  divide : Given  the fact that there  still persists  a substantial  section  of the \\npopulation  whose  digital  access  is highly  limited,  the existing  mass  media,  such as televisio n, \\nradio,  and community  radio  will be extensively  used for telecast  and broadcasts.  Such  educational  \\nprogrammes  will be made  available  24/7 in different  languages  to cater  to the varying  needs  of \\nthe student  population.  A special  focus  on content  in all Indian languages  will be emphasi zed and \\nrequired;  digital  content  will need  to reach  the teachers  and students  in their medium  of \\ninstruct ion as far as possible.  \\n \\n(f) Virtual  Labs:  Existing  e-learning  platforms  such as DIKSHA,  SWAYAM  and \\nSWAYAMPRABHA  will also be leveraged  for creating  virtual  labs so that all students  have \\nequal  access  to quality  practical  and hands -on experiment -based  learning  experiences.  The \\npossibility  of providing  adequate  access  to SEDG  students  and teachers  through  suitable  digital  \\ndevices,  such as tablets  with pre-loaded  content,  will be considered  and developed.   \\n \\n(g) Training  and incentives  for teachers : Teachers  will undergo  rigorous  training  in learner -centric  \\npedagogy  and on how to become  high-quality  online  content  creators  them selves  using  online  \\nteaching  platforms  and tools.  There  will be emphasis  on the teacher’s  role in facilitating  active  \\nstudent  engagement  with the content  and with each other.

Studies  will be undertaken  to pilot new ways  \\nof assessment  using  education  technologies  focusing  on 21st century  skills.  \\n \\n(i) Blended  models  of learning : While  promoting  digital  learning  and education,  the importance  of \\nface-to-face in-person  learning  is fully  recogni zed. Accordingly,  different  effective  models  of \\nblended  learning  will be identified  for appropriate  replication  for different  subjects.  \\n \\n(j) Laying  down  standards : As research  on online/digital  education  emerges,  NETF  and other  \\nappropriate  bodies  shall  set up standards  of content,  technology,  and pedagogy  for online/digital  \\nteaching -learning.  These  standards  will help to formulate  guidelines  for e-learning  by States,  \\nBoards,  schools  and school  complexes,  HEIs,  etc. \\n \\n24.5 Creating  a Dedicated  Unit  for Buildi ng of World Class, Digital  Infrastructure,  \\nEducational  Digital  Content  and Capacity  \\n \\nTechnology  in education  is a journey  and not a destination  and capacity  will be needed  to orchestrate  \\nthe various  ecosystem  players  to implement  policy  objectives.

Since  technology  is rapidly  evolving,  and needs  specialists  to deliver  high quality  \\ne-learning,  a vibrant  ecosyste m has to be encouraged  to create  solutions  that not only solve  \\nIndia ’s challenges  of scale,  diversity,  equity,  but also evolve  in keeping  with the rapid  \\nchanges  in technol ogy, whose  half-life reduces  with each passing  year.   This centre  will, \\ntherefore , consist of experts  drawn  from  the field of administration,  education,  educational  \\ntechnology,  digital  pedagogy  and assessment,  e-governance,  etc.  \\n \\nPart  IV. MAKING  IT HAPPEN  \\n25. Strengthening  the Central  Advisory  Board  of Education   \\n25.1. Achieving  successful  implementation  of this policy  demands  a long-term vision,  availability  of \\nexpertise  on a sustained  basis,  and concerted  action  from  all concerned  encompassing  National,  State, \\ninstitutional,  and individual  levels.  In this context,  the Policy  recommends  strengthening  and \\nempowering  the Central  Advisory  Board  of Education  (CABE ) which  will have  a much  greater  \\nmandate  and not only a forum  for widespread  consultation  and exam ination of issues  relating  to \\neducational  and cultural  development.  The remodeled  and rejuvenated  CABE  shall  also be \\nresponsible  for developing,  articulating,  evaluating,  and revising  the vision  of education  in the \\ncountry  on a continuous  basis,  in close  collaboration  with MHRD  and the corresponding  apex  bodies  \\nof States.  It shall  also create  and continuously  review  the institutional  frameworks  that shall  help \\nattain  this vision.  \\n25.2. To bring  the focus  back  on education  and learning,  it is desirable  that the Ministry  of Human  \\nResource  Development  (MHRD)  be re-designated  as the Ministry  of Education  (MoE).  \\n26. Financing:  Affordable  and Quality  Education  for All \\n26.1. The Policy  commits  to significantly  raising  educational  investment,  as there  is no better  \\ninvestment  towards  a society  ’s future  than the high-quality  education  of our young  people.  \\nUnfortunately,  public  expenditure  on education  in India  has not come  close  to the recommended  level  \\nof 6% of GDP,  as envisaged  by the 1968  Policy,  reiterated  in the Policy  of 1986,  and which  was \\nfurther  reaffirmed  in the 1992  review  of the Policy.  The current  public  (Government  - Centre  and \\nStates)  expenditure  on education  in India  has been  around  4.43%  of GDP  (Analysis  of Budgeted  ', metadata={'source': '/Users/anupam/Documents/Debtanaya docs/National_Education_Policy_2020.pdf', 'page': 60}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\" \\n \\nNational  Education  Policy  2020  \\n61 \\n Expenditure  2017 -18) and only around  10% of the total Government  spending  towards  education  \\n(Economic  Survey  2017 -18). These  numbers  are far smaller  than most  developed  and developing  \\ncountries.   \\n26.2. In order  to attain  the goal of education  with excellence  and the corresponding  multitude  of \\nbenefits  to this Nation  and its economy,  this Policy  unequivocally  endorses  and envisions  a \\nsubstantial  increase  in public  investment  in education  by both the Central  government  and all State  \\nGovernments . The Centre  and the States  will work  together  to increase  the public  investment  in \\nEducation  sector  to reach  6% of GDP  at the earliest . This is considered  extremely  critical  for \\nachieving  the high-quality  and equitable  public  education  system  that is truly  needed  for India's  future  \\neconomic,  social,  cultur al, intellectual,  and techno logical  progress  and growth.  \\n26.3. In particular,  financial  support  will be provided  to various  critical  elements  and components  of \\neducation,  such as ensuring  universal  access,  learning  resources,  nutritional  support,  matters  of \\nstudent  safety  and well-being, adequate  numbers  of teachers  and staff,  teacher  development,  and \\nsupport  for all key initiatives  towards  equitable  high-quality  education  for underprivileged  and socio -\\neconomically  disadvantaged  groups.  \\n26.4. In addition  to one-time expenditures,  prim arily related  to infrastructure  and resources,  this \\nPolicy  identifies  the following  key long-term thrust  areas  for financing  to cultivate  an education  \\nsystem:  (a) universal  provisioning  of quality  early  childhood  care education;  (b) ensuring  \\nfoundational  literacy  and numeracy;  (c) providing  adequate  and appropriate  resourcing  of school  \\ncomplexes/clusters;  (d) providing  food and nutrition  (breakfast  and midday  meals);  (e) investing  in \\nteacher  education  and continuing  professional  development  of teachers;  (f) revamping  colleges  and \\nuniversities  to foster  excellence;  (g) cultivating  research ; and (h) extensive  use of technology  and \\nonline  education . \\n26.5. Even  the low level  of funding  on education  in India , is frequently  not spent  in a timely  mann er \\nat the District/institution  level,  hampering  the achievement  of the intended  targets  of those  funds.  \\nHence,  the need  is to increase  efficiency  in use of available  budget  by suitable  policy  changes.  \\nFinancial  governance  and management  will focus  on the smooth,  timely,  and appropriate  flow of \\nfunds,  and their usage  with probity;  administrative  processes  will be suitably  amended  and \\nstreamlined  so that the disbursal  mechanism  may not lead to a high volume  of unspent  balances.  The \\nprovisions  of GFR,  PFMS  and ‘Just in Time’  release  to implementing  agencies  will be followed  for \\nefficient  use of government  resources  and avoiding  parking  of funds.  Mechanism  of performance -\\nbased  funding  to State s / HEIs  may be devised.  Similarly,  efficient  mechanism  will be ensure d for the \\noptimal  allocation  and utilization  of funds  earmarked  for SEDGs.  The new suggested  regulatory  \\nregime,  with clear  separations  of roles  and transparent  self-disclosures,  empowerment  and autonomy  \\nto institutions,  and the appointment  of outstanding  and qualified  experts  to leadership  positions  will \\nhelp to enable  a far smoother,  quicker,  and more  transparent  flow of funds.  \\n26.6. The Policy  also calls for the rejuvenation,  active  promotion,  and support  for private  \\nphilanthropic  activity  in the education  sector.  In particular,  over and above  the public  budgetary  \\nsupport  which  would  have  been  otherwise  provided  to them , any public  institution  can take initiatives  \\ntowards  raising  private  philanthropic  funds  to enhance  educational  experiences . \\n26.7. The matter  of commercialization  of education  has been  dealt  with by the Policy  through  \\nmultiple  relevant  fronts,  including:  the  ‘light but tight’  regulatory  approach  that mandates  full public  \\nself-disclosure  of finances,  procedures,  course  and programme  offerings,  and educational  outcomes;  \\nthe substantial  investment  in public  education;  and mechanisms  for good  governance  of all \\ninstitutions,  public  and private.  Similarly,  opportunities  for higher  cost recovery  without  affecting  the \\nneedy  or deservin g sections will also be explored.  \\n27. Implementation  \\n27.1. Any policy’s effectiveness  depends  on its implementation.  Such  implementation  will require  \\nmultiple  initiatives  and actions,  which  will have  to be taken  by multiple  bodies  in a synchronized  and \", metadata={'source': '/Users/anupam/Documents/Debtanaya docs/National_Education_Policy_2020.pdf', 'page': 61}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=' \\n \\nNational  Education  Policy  2020  \\n62 \\n systemati c manner.  Therefore,  the implementation  of this Policy  will be led by various  bodies  \\nincluding  MHRD,  CABE,  Union  and State  Governments,  education -related  Ministries,  State  \\nDepartments  of Education,  Boards,  NTA,  the regulatory  bodies  of school  and higher education,  \\nNCERT,  SCERTs,  schools,  and HEIs  along  with timelines  and a plan for review,  in order  to ensure  \\nthat the policy  is implemented  in its spirit  and intent,  through  coherence  in planning  and synergy  \\nacross  all these  bodies  involved  in education.  \\n27.2. Implementation  will be guided  by the following  principles.  First,  implementation  of the spirit  \\nand intent  of the Policy  will be the most  critical  matter.  Second,  it is important  to implement  the \\npolicy  initiatives  in a phased  manner,  as each policy  point  has several  steps,  each of which  requires  \\nthe previous  step to be implemented  successfully.  Third,  prioritization  will be important  in ensuring  \\noptimal  sequencing  of policy  points,  and that the most  critical  and urgent  actions  are taken  up first, \\nthereby enabling  a strong  base.  Fourth,  comprehensiveness  in implementation  will be key; as this \\nPolicy  is interconnected  and holistic,  only a full-fledged  implementation,  and not a piecemeal  one, \\nwill ensure  that the desired  objectives  are achieved.  Fifth,  since education  is a concurrent  subject,  it \\nwill need  careful  planning,  joint monitoring,  and collaborative  implementati on between  the Centre  \\nand States.  Sixth,  timely  infusion  of requisite  resources  - human,  infrastructural,  and financial  - at the \\nCentral  and State  levels  will be crucial  for the satisfactory  execution  of the Policy.  Finally,  careful  \\nanalysis  and review  of the linkages  between  multiple  parallel  implementation  steps  will be necessary  \\nin order  to ensure  effective  dovetailing  of all initiatives . This will also include  early  investment  in \\nsome  of the specific  actions  (such  as the setting  up of early  childhood  care and education  \\ninfrastructure)  that will be imperative  to ensuring  a strong  base and a smooth  progression  for all \\nsubsequent  programmes  and actions.  \\n27.3. Subject -wise implementation  committees  of experts  in cooperation  and consultation  with other  \\nreleva nt Ministries  will be set up at both the Central  and State  levels  to develop  detailed  \\nimplementation  plans  for each aspect  of this Policy  in accordance  with the above  principles  to \\nachieve  the goals  of the Policy  in a clear  and phased  manner.  Yearly  joint reviews  of the progress  of \\nimplementation  of the policy,  in accordance  with the targets  set for each action,  will be conducted  by \\ndesigna ted teams  constituted  by MHRD  and the States,  and reviews  will be shared  with CABE . In the \\ndecade  of 2030 -40, the entire policy  will be in an operational  mode,  following  which  another  \\ncomprehensive  review  will be undertaken.   \\n \\n*********  \\n  ', metadata={'source': '/Users/anupam/Documents/Debtanaya docs/National_Education_Policy_2020.pdf', 'page': 62}),\n",

With  climate  change,  increasing  pollution,  and depleting  natural  \\nresources,  there  will be a sizeable  shift in how we meet  the world ’s energy,  water,  food,  and \\nsanitation  needs,  again resulting  in the need  for new skille d labour,  particularly  in biology,  chemistry,  \\nphysics,  agriculture,  climate  science,  and social  science.  The growing  emergence  of epidemics  and \\npandemics  will also call for collaborative  research  in infectious  diseas e management  and \\ndevelopment  of vaccines  and the resultant  social  issues  heightens  the need  for multidisciplinary  \\nlearning.  There  will be a growing  demand  for humanities  and art, as India  moves  towards  becoming  a \\ndeveloped  country  as well as among  the three largest  economies  in the world.  \\nIndeed , with the quickly  changing  employment  landscape  and global  ecosystem,  it is becoming  \\nincreasingly  critical  that children  not only learn , but more  importantly  learn  how to learn.  Education  \\nthus, must  move  towards  less content,  and more  towards  learning  about how to think  critically  and \\nsolve  problems,  how to be creative  and multidisciplinary,  and how to innovate,  adapt,  and absorb  new \\nmaterial  in novel  and changing  fields.  Pedagogy  must  evolve  to make  education  more  experiential,  \\nholistic,  integrated,  inqui ry-driven,  discovery -oriented,  learner -centred,  discussion -based,  flexible,  \\nand, of course,  enjoyable.  The curriculum  must  include  basic  arts, crafts,  humanities,  games,  sports  \\nand fitness,  languages,  literature,  culture, and values,  in addition  to science  and mathematics,  to \\ndevelop  all aspects  and capabilities  of learne rs; and make  education  more  well-rounded,  useful,  and', metadata={'source': '/Users/anupam/Documents/Debtanaya docs/National_Education_Policy_2020.pdf', 'page': 3})"

Curtailing  Dropout  Rates  and Ensuring  Universal  Access  to Education  at All Levels  \\n3.1. One of the primary  goals  of the schooling  system  must  be to ensure  that children  are enrolled  in \\nand are attending  school.  Through  initiatives  such as the Sarva  Shiksha  Abhiyan  (now  the Samagra  \\nShiksha ) and the Right  to Education  Act, India  has made  remarkable  strides  in recent years  in \\nattaining  near-universal  enrolment  in elementary  education.  However,  the data for later grades  \\nindicates  some  serious  issues  in retaining  children  in the schooling  system .

A concerted  \\nnational  effort  will be made  to ensure  universal  access  and afford  opportunity  to all children  of the \\ncountry  to obtain  quality  holistic  education–including  vocational  education  - from  pre-school  to \\nGrade  12.  \\n3.2.

       " Document(page_content='National  Education  Policy  2020  \\n44 \\n 16.2.   One of the primary  reasons  for the small  numbers  of students  receiving  vocational  education  is \\nthe fact that vocational  education  has in the past focused  largely  on Grades  11–12 and  on dropouts  in \\nGrade  8 and upwards.  Moreover,  students  passing  out from  Grades  11–12 with vocational  subjects  \\noften  did not have  well-defined  pathways  to continue  with their chosen  vocations  in higher  education.  \\nThe admission  criteria  for general  higher  education  were  also not designed  to provide  openings  to \\nstudents  who had vocational  education  qualifications,  leaving  them  at a disadvantage  relative  to their \\ncompatriots  from   ‘mainstream ’ or  ‘academic’ education . This led to a complete  lack of vertical  \\nmobility  for students  from  the vocational  education  stream,  an issue  that has only been  addressed  \\nrecently  through  the announcement  of the National  Skills  Qualifications  Framework  (NSQF)  in 2013.  \\n16.3. Vocational  education  is perceived  to be inferior  to mainstream  education  and meant  largely  for \\nstudents  who are unable  to cope  with the latter.  This is a percept ion that affects  the choices  students  \\nmake.  It is a serious  concern  that can only be dealt  with by a complete  re-imagination  of how \\nvocational  education  is offered  to students  in the future.   \\n16.4.  This policy  aims  to overcome  the social  status  hierarchy  associated  with vocational  education    \\nand requires  integration  of vocational  education  programmes  into mainstream  education  in all \\neducation  institutions  in a phased  manner . Beginning  with vocational  exposure  at early  ages in \\nmiddle  and secondary  school , quality  vocational  education  will be integrated  smoothly  into higher  \\neducation . It will ensure that every  child  learns  at least one vocation  and is exposed  to several  more .', metadata={})]"
